In choosing representative sam ples, the notified body shall take into  account the published guidance developed by the MDCG pursuant to Ar ticle 105 and in par ticular the no velty of  the tec hnology , similar ities in design, te chnology , manuf actur ing and steril isation methods, the intended pur pose  and the results of any previous relevant assessments such as with regar d to phy sical, c hemical, biological or  clinical proper ties, that hav e been car r ied out in accordance with this Regulation. The notifi ed body in question  shall document its rationale f or the sample s taken.  If the quality managemen t system conf or ms to the relevant pro visions of this Regulation, the notified body shall  issue an EU quality managemen t syste m cer tif icat e. The notified body shall notify the manufacturer of its  decision to issue the cer tif icat e. The decision shall contain the conclusions of the audit and a reasoned repor t.  2.4.  The manufact urer in question shall inf or m the notified body which appro ved the quality manage ment system of  any plan f or substantial chang es to the quality manage ment system, or the device-range co vered. The notified  body shall assess the chang es proposed, det er mine the need f or additional audits and ver ify whether af ter those  chang es the quality management system still meets the requirements refer red to in Section 2.2. It shall notify the  manufacturer of its decision whic h shall contain the conclusions of the assessment, and where applicable,  conclusions of additional audits. The appro val of an y substantial chang e to the quality manag ement system or  the device-range co vered shall take the f or m of a supplement to the EU quality management system cer tif icat e.  3.  Sur veillance assessment applicable to class IIa, class IIb and class III devices  3.1.  The aim of sur veillance is to ensure that the manufacturer duly fulfils the oblig ations ar ising from the appro ved  quality management system.  3.2.  The manufacturer shall give author isation to the notified body to car r y out all the necessar y audits, including on-  site audits, and supply it with all relevant inf or mation, in par ticular:  —  the documentation on its quality manag ement syste m,  —  documentation on any findings and conclusions resulting from the application of the post-market  sur veillance plan, including the PMCF plan, f or a representative sample of devices, and of the pro visions on  vigilance set out in Ar ticles 87 to 92,  —  the data stipulat ed in the par t of the quality management syste m relating to design, such as the results of  analyses, calculations, tests and the solutions adopt ed regarding the r isk -manage ment as refer red to in  Section 4 of Annex I, and  —  the data stipulat ed in the par t of the quality management system relating to manufacture, such as quality  control repor ts and te st data, calibration data, and records on the qualifications of the personnel concer ned.  3.3.  Notif ied bodies shall per iodically , at least once ever y 12 months, car r y out appropr iat e audits and assessments to  make sure that the manuf acturer in question applies the appro ved quality manage ment system and the post-  market sur veillance plan. Those audits and assessments shall include audits on the premises of the manufacturer  and, if appropr iat e, of the manufacturer's suppliers and/or subcontractor s. At the time of such on-site audits, the  notifi ed body shall, where necessar y , car r y out or ask f or tes ts in order to c heck that the quality management  system is w orking properly . It shall pro vide the manufact urer with a sur veillance audit repor t and, if a tes t has  been car r ied out, with a tes t repor t.  3.4.  The notifi ed body shall randomly perform at least once ever y fi ve ye ars unannounced audits on the site of the  manufacturer and, where appropr iat e, of the manuf acturer's suppliers and/or subcontractors, which ma y be  combined with the per iodic sur veillance assessment refer red to in Section 3.3. or be performe d in addition to  that sur veillance assessment. The notified body shall establish a plan f or such unannounced on-site audits but  shall not disclose it to the manufa cturer .  5.5.2017 L 117/148 Official Jour nal of the European Union EN\",\n",

This could involve a compilation of existing scientific literature or clinical investigations.  The investigations must follow ethical guidelines (Helsinki Declaration), have a well-defined plan, and include sufficient observations for valid conclusions.  All adverse incidents must be recorded and reported.  A written report critically evaluating all data is mandatory.  The MDD text does not specify the extent or detail required for clinical data or investigations for Class IIa devices specifically.\n",

While the MDD allows for reliance on literature reviews in certain cases, the MDR mandates a full clinical evaluation  (details unspecified in the provided text) and a PMCF.  The level of detail and rigor required for this evaluation under the MDR likely exceeds that of the MDD, although the precise extent is not described in this excerpt.  The MDR also introduces the concept of common specifications, which manufacturers must comply with unless they can justify equivalent solutions.  The absence of  Article 61 and Annex XIV content prevents a detailed comparison of specific requirements.\n",

Assess whether your existing clinical data meets the more stringent MDR requirements,  and plan for any necessary additional clinical studies or literature reviews to ensure compliance.
