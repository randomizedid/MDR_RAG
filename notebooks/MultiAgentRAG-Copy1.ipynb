      "    \"#### **INTRODUCTION**\\n\\n_I. PURPOSE_\\n\\nThis guidance is intended to assist manufacturers in understanding quality system requirements concerning design controls. Assistance is provided by interpreting the language of the quality systems requirements and explaining the underlying concepts in practical terms.\",\n",
      "    \"Design controls are an interrelated set of practices and procedures that are incorporated into the design and development process, i.e., a system of checks and balances. Design controls make systematic assessment of the design an integral part of development. As a result, deficiencies in design input requirements, and discrepancies between the proposed designs and requirements, are made evident and corrected earlier in the development process. Design controls increase the likelihood that the design transferred to production will translate into a device that is appropriate for its intended use.\",\n",
      "    \"In practice, design controls provide managers and designers with improved visibility of the design process. With improved visibility, managers are empowered to more effectively direct the design process—that is, to recognize problems earlier, make corrections, and adjust resource allocations. Designers benefit both by enhanced understanding of the degree of conformance of a design to user and patient needs, and by improved communications and coordination among all participants in the process.\",\n",
      "    \"The medical device industry encompasses a wide range of technologies and applications, ranging from simple hand tools to complex computer-controlled surgical machines, from implantable screws to artificial organs, from blood-glucose test strips to diagnostic imaging systems and laboratory test equipment. These devices are manufactured by companies varying in size and structure, methods of design and development, and methods of management. These factors significantly influence how design controls are actually applied. Given this diversity, this guidance does not suggest particular methods of implementation, and therefore, must not be used to assess compliance with the quality system requirements. Rather, the intent is to expand upon the distilled language of the quality system requirements with practical explanations and examples of design control principles. Armed with this basic knowledge, manufacturers can and should seek out technology-specific guidance on applying design controls to their particular situation.\",\n",
      "    \"When using this guidance, there could be a tendency to focus only on the time and effort required in developing and incorporating the controls into the design process. However, readers should keep in mind the intrinsic value of design controls as well. It is a well-established fact that the cost to correct design errors is lower when errors are detected early in the design and development process. Large and small companies that have achieved quality systems certification under ISO 9001 cite improvements in productivity, product quality, customer satisfaction, and company competitiveness. Additional benefits are described in comments received from a quality assurance manager of a medical device firm regarding the value of a properly documented design control system:\\n\\n\\\"...there are benefits to an organization and the quality improvement of an organization by having a written design control system. By defining this system on paper, a corporation allows all its employees to understand the requirements, the process, and expectations of design and how the quality of design is assured and perceived by the system. It also provides a baseline to review the system periodically for further improvements based on history, problems, and failures of the system (not the product).\\\"\",\n",
      "    \"_II. SCOPE_\\n\\nThe guidance applies to the design of medical devices as well as the design of the associated manufacturing processes. The guidance is applicable to new designs as well as modifications or improvements to existing device designs. The guidance discusses subjects in the order in which they appear in FDA's Quality System regulation and is cross-referenced to International Organization for Standards (ISO) 9001:1994, _Quality Systems Model for Quality Assurance in Design, Development, Production, Installation, and Servicing_, and the ISO draft international standard ISO/DIS 13485, _Quality Systems  Medical Devices  Particular Requirements for the Application of ISO 9001_, dated April 1996.\",\n",
      "    \"Design controls are a component of a comprehensive quality system that covers the life of a device. The assurance process is a total systems approach that extends from the development of device requirements through design, production, distribution, use, maintenance, and eventually, obsolescence. Design control begins with development and approval of design inputs, and includes the design of a device and the associated manufacturing processes.\",\n",
      "    \"Design control does not end with the transfer of a design to production. Design control applies to all changes to the device or manufacturing process design, including those occurring long after a device has been introduced to the market. This includes evolutionary changes such as performance enhancements as well as revolutionary changes such as corrective actions resulting from the analysis of failed product. The changes are part of a continuous, ongoing effort to design and develop a device that meets the needs of the user and/or patient. Thus, the design control process is revisited many times during the life of a product.\",\n",
      "    \"Some tools and techniques are described in the guidance. Although aspects of their utility are sometimes described, they are included in the guidance for illustrative purposes only. Including them does not mean that they are preferred. There may be alternative ways that are better suited to a particular manufacturer and design activity. The literature contains an abundance of information on tools and techniques. Such topics as project management, design review, process capability, and many others referred to in this guidance are available in textbooks, periodicals, and journals. As a manufacturer applies design controls to a particular task, the appropriate tools and techniques used by competent personnel should be applied to meet the needs of the unique product or process for that manufacturer.\",\n",
      "    \"_III. APPLICATION OF DESIGN CONTROLS_\\n\\nDesign controls may be applied to any product development process. The simple example shown in Figure 1 illustrates the influence of design controls on a design process.\",\n",
      "    \"The development process depicted in the example is a traditional waterfall model. The design proceeds in a logical sequence of phases or stages. Basically, requirements are developed, and a device is designed to meet those requirements. The design is then evaluated, transferred to production, and the device is manufactured. In practice, feedback paths would be required between each phase of the process and previous phases, representing the iterative nature of product development. However, this detail has been omitted from the figure to make the influence of the design controls on the design process more distinct.\",\n",
      "    \"The importance of the design input and verification of design outputs is illustrated by this example. When the design input has been reviewed and the design input requirements are determined to be acceptable, an iterative process of translating those requirements into a device design begins. The first step is conversion of the requirements into system or high-level specifications. Thus, these specifications are a design output. Upon verification that the high-level specifications conform to the design input requirements, they become the design input for the next step in the design process, and so on.\",\n",
      "    \"This basic technique is used repeatedly throughout the design process. Each design input is converted into a new design output; each output is verified as conforming to its input; and it then becomes the design input for another step in the design process. In this manner, the design input requirements are translated into a device design conforming to those requirements.\",\n",
      "    \"The importance of design reviews is also illustrated by the example. The design reviews are conducted at strategic points in the design process. For example, a review is conducted to assure that the design input requirements are adequate before they are converted into the design specifications. Another is used to assure that the device design is adequate before prototypes are produced for simulated use testing and clinical evaluation. Another, a validation review, is conducted prior to transfer of the design to production. Generally, they are used to provide assurance that an activity or phase has been completed in an acceptable manner, and that the next activity or phase can begin.\",\n",
      "    \"As the figure illustrates, design validation encompasses verification and extends the assessment to address whether devices produced in accordance with the design actually satisfy user needs and intended uses.\",\n",
      "    \"An analogy to automobile design and development may help to clarify these concepts. Fuel efficiency is a common design requirement. This requirement might be expressed as the number of miles-per-gallon of a particular grade of gasoline for a specified set of driving conditions. As the design of the car proceeds, the requirements, including the one for fuel efficiency, are converted into the many layers of system and subsystem specifications needed for design. As these various systems and subsystems are designed, design verification methods are used to establish conformance of each design to its own specifications. Because several specifications directly affect fuel efficiency, many of the verification activities help to provide confirmation that the overall design will meet the fuel efficiency requirement. This might include simulated road testing of prototypes or actual road testing. This is establishing by objective evidence that the design output conforms to the fuel efficiency requirement. However, these verification activities alone are not sufficient to validate the design. The design may be validated when a representative sample of users have driven production vehicles under a specified range of driving conditions and judged the fuel efficiency to be adequate. This is providing objective evidence that the particular requirement for a specific intended use can be consistently fulfilled.\",\n",
      "    \"**CONCURRENT ENGINEERING** . Although the waterfall model is a useful tool for introducing design controls, its usefulness in practice is limited. The model does apply to the development of some simpler devices. However, for more complex devices, a concurrent engineering model is more representative of the design processes in use in the industry.\",\n",
      "    \"In a traditional waterfall development scenario, the engineering department completes the product design and formally transfers the design to production. Subsequently, other departments or organizations develop processes to manufacture and service the product. Historically, there has frequently been a divergence between the intent of the designer and the reality of the factory floor, resulting in such undesirable outcomes as low manufacturing yields, rework or redesign of the product, or unexpectedly high cost to service the product.\",\n",
      "    \"One benefit of concurrent engineering is the involvement of production and service personnel throughout the design process, assuring the mutual optimization of the characteristics of a device and its related processes. While the primary motivations of concurrent engineering are shorter development time and reduced production cost, the practical result is often improved product quality.\",\n",
      "    \"Concurrent engineering encompasses a range of practices and techniques. From a design control standpoint, it is sufficient to note that concurrent engineering may blur the line between development and production. On the one hand, the concurrent engineering model properly emphasizes that the development of production processes is a design rather than a manufacturing activity. On the other hand, various components of a design may enter production before the design as a whole has been approved. Thus, concurrent engineering and other more complex models of development usually require a comprehensive matrix of reviews and approvals to ensure that each component and process design is validated prior to entering production, and the product as a whole is validated prior to design release.\",\n",
      "    \"**RISK MANAGEMENT AND DESIGN CONTROLS** . Risk management is the systematic application of management policies, procedures, and practices to the tasks of identifying, analyzing, controlling, and monitoring risk. It is intended to be a framework within which experience, insight, and judgment are applied to successfully manage risk. It is included in this guidance because of its effect on the design process.\",\n",
      "    \"Risk management begins with the development of the design input requirements. As the design evolves, new risks may become evident. To systematically identify and, when necessary, reduce these risks, the risk management process is integrated into the design process. In this way, unacceptable risks can be identified and managed earlier in the design process when changes are easier to make and less costly.\",\n",
      "    \"An example of this is an exposure control system for a general purpose x-ray system. The control function was allocated to software. Late in the development process, risk analysis of the system uncovered several failure modes that could result in overexposure to the patient. Because the problem was not identified until the design was near completion, an expensive, independent, back-up timer had to be added to monitor exposure times.\",\n",
      "    \"**THE QUALITY SYSTEM AND DESIGN CONTROLS** . In addition to procedures and work instructions necessary for the implementation of design controls, policies and procedures may also be needed for other determinants of device quality that should be considered during the design process. The need for policies and procedures for these factors is dependent upon the types of devices manufactured by a company and the risks associated with their use. Management with executive responsibility has the responsibility for determining what is needed.\",\n",
      "    \"Example of topics for which policies and procedures may be appropriate are:\\n\\n  - risk management\\n\\n  - device reliability\\n\\n  - device durability\\n\\n  - device maintainability\\n\\n  - device serviceability\\n\\n  - human factors engineering\\n\\n  - software engineering\\n\\n  - use of standards\\n\\n  - configuration management\\n\\n  - compliance with regulatory requirements\\n\\n  - device evaluation (which may include third party product certification or approval)\\n\\n  - clinical evaluations\\n\\n  - document controls\\n\\n  - use of consultants\\n\\n  - use of subcontractors\\n\\n  - use of company historical data\",\n",

Study Group 3 has recognized FDA’s need to publish timely guidance on this topic in conjunction with promulgation of its new Quality System Regulation. The Study Group has therefore devoted considerable time and effort to combine its draft document with the FDA's efforts as well as to review and comment on FDA's subsequent revisions. FDA, for its part, delayed final release of its guidance pending final review by the Study Group. As a result, it is hoped that this document, with some minor editorial revisions to make the guidance global to several regulatory schemes, will be recognized through the GHTF as an international guidance document.\", '#### **TABLE OF CONTENTS**\\n\\nFFOREWORD................................................................................................................... i\\n\\nPREFACE...................................................................................................................... iii\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT.............................................................................................. iv\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS ................................................................................................ v\\n\\nINTRODUCTION .......................................................................................................... 1\\n\\nSECTION A.

PURPOSE_\\n\\nThis guidance is intended to assist manufacturers in understanding quality system requirements concerning design controls. Assistance is provided by interpreting the language of the quality systems requirements and explaining the underlying concepts in practical terms.', 'Design controls are an interrelated set of practices and procedures that are incorporated into the design and development process, i.e., a system of checks and balances. Design controls make systematic assessment of the design an integral part of development. As a result, deficiencies in design input requirements, and discrepancies between the proposed designs and requirements, are made evident and corrected earlier in the development process. Design controls increase the likelihood that the design transferred to production will translate into a device that is appropriate for its intended use.', 'In practice, design controls provide managers and designers with improved visibility of the design process. With improved visibility, managers are empowered to more effectively direct the design process—that is, to recognize problems earlier, make corrections, and adjust resource allocations. Designers benefit both by enhanced understanding of the degree of conformance of a design to user and patient needs, and by improved communications and coordination among all participants in the process.', 'The medical device industry encompasses a wide range of technologies and applications, ranging from simple hand tools to complex computer-controlled surgical machines, from implantable screws to artificial organs, from blood-glucose test strips to diagnostic imaging systems and laboratory test equipment. These devices are manufactured by companies varying in size and structure, methods of design and development, and methods of management. These factors significantly influence how design controls are actually applied. Given this diversity, this guidance does not suggest particular methods of implementation, and therefore, must not be used to assess compliance with the quality system requirements. Rather, the intent is to expand upon the distilled language of the quality system requirements with practical explanations and examples of design control principles. Armed with this basic knowledge, manufacturers can and should seek out technology-specific guidance on applying design controls to their particular situation.', 'When using this guidance, there could be a tendency to focus only on the time and effort required in developing and incorporating the controls into the design process. However, readers should keep in mind the intrinsic value of design controls as well. It is a well-established fact that the cost to correct design errors is lower when errors are detected early in the design and development process. Large and small companies that have achieved quality systems certification under ISO 9001 cite improvements in productivity, product quality, customer satisfaction, and company competitiveness. Additional benefits are described in comments received from a quality assurance manager of a medical device firm regarding the value of a properly documented design control system:\\n\\n\"...there are benefits to an organization and the quality improvement of an organization by having a written design control system. By defining this system on paper, a corporation allows all its employees to understand the requirements, the process, and expectations of design and how the quality of design is assured and perceived by the system. It also provides a baseline to review the system periodically for further improvements based on history, problems, and failures of the system (not the product).\"', \"_II. SCOPE_\\n\\nThe guidance applies to the design of medical devices as well as the design of the associated manufacturing processes. The guidance is applicable to new designs as well as modifications or improvements to existing device designs. The guidance discusses subjects in the order in which they appear in FDA's Quality System regulation and is cross-referenced to International Organization for Standards (ISO) 9001:1994, _Quality Systems Model for Quality Assurance in Design, Development, Production, Installation, and Servicing_, and the ISO draft international standard ISO/DIS 13485, _Quality Systems \\uf8e7 Medical Devices \\uf8e7 Particular Requirements for the Application of ISO 9001_, dated April 1996.\", 'Design controls are a component of a comprehensive quality system that covers the life of a device. The assurance process is a total systems approach that extends from the development of device requirements through design, production, distribution, use, maintenance, and eventually, obsolescence. Design control begins with development and approval of design inputs, and includes the design of a device and the associated manufacturing processes.', 'Design control does not end with the transfer of a design to production. Design control applies to all changes to the device or manufacturing process design, including those occurring long after a device has been introduced to the market. This includes evolutionary changes such as performance enhancements as well as revolutionary changes such as corrective actions resulting from the analysis of failed product. The changes are part of a continuous, ongoing effort to design and develop a device that meets the needs of the user and/or patient. Thus, the design control process is revisited many times during the life of a product.', 'Some tools and techniques are described in the guidance. Although aspects of their utility are sometimes described, they are included in the guidance for illustrative purposes only. Including them does not mean that they are preferred. There may be alternative ways that are better suited to a particular manufacturer and design activity. The literature contains an abundance of information on tools and techniques. Such topics as project management, design review, process capability, and many others referred to in this guidance are available in textbooks, periodicals, and journals. As a manufacturer applies design controls to a particular task, the appropriate tools and techniques used by competent personnel should be applied to meet the needs of the unique product or process for that manufacturer.', '_III. APPLICATION OF DESIGN CONTROLS_\\n\\nDesign controls may be applied to any product development process. The simple example shown in Figure 1 illustrates the influence of design controls on a design process.', 'The development process depicted in the example is a traditional waterfall model. The design proceeds in a logical sequence of phases or stages. Basically, requirements are developed, and a device is designed to meet those requirements. The design is then evaluated, transferred to production, and the device is manufactured. In practice, feedback paths would be required between each phase of the process and previous phases, representing the iterative nature of product development. However, this detail has been omitted from the figure to make the influence of the design controls on the design process more distinct.', 'The importance of the design input and verification of design outputs is illustrated by this example. When the design input has been reviewed and the design input requirements are determined to be acceptable, an iterative process of translating those requirements into a device design begins. The first step is conversion of the requirements into system or high-level specifications. Thus, these specifications are a design output. Upon verification that the high-level specifications conform to the design input requirements, they become the design input for the next step in the design process, and so on.', 'This basic technique is used repeatedly throughout the design process. Each design input is converted into a new design output; each output is verified as conforming to its input; and it then becomes the design input for another step in the design process. In this manner, the design input requirements are translated into a device design conforming to those requirements.', 'The importance of design reviews is also illustrated by the example. The design reviews are conducted at strategic points in the design process. For example, a review is conducted to assure that the design input requirements are adequate before they are converted into the design specifications. Another is used to assure that the device design is adequate before prototypes are produced for simulated use testing and clinical evaluation. Another, a validation review, is conducted prior to transfer of the design to production. Generally, they are used to provide assurance that an activity or phase has been completed in an acceptable manner, and that the next activity or phase can begin.', 'As the figure illustrates, design validation encompasses verification and extends the assessment to address whether devices produced in accordance with the design actually satisfy user needs and intended uses.', 'An analogy to automobile design and development may help to clarify these concepts. Fuel efficiency is a common design requirement. This requirement might be expressed as the number of miles-per-gallon of a particular grade of gasoline for a specified set of driving conditions. As the design of the car proceeds, the requirements, including the one for fuel efficiency, are converted into the many layers of system and subsystem specifications needed for design. As these various systems and subsystems are designed, design verification methods are used to establish conformance of each design to its own specifications. Because several specifications directly affect fuel efficiency, many of the verification activities help to provide confirmation that the overall design will meet the fuel efficiency requirement. This might include simulated road testing of prototypes or actual road testing. This is establishing by objective evidence that the design output conforms to the fuel efficiency requirement. However, these verification activities alone are not sufficient to validate the design. The design may be validated when a representative sample of users have driven production vehicles under a specified range of driving conditions and judged the fuel efficiency to be adequate. This is providing objective evidence that the particular requirement for a specific intended use can be consistently fulfilled.', '**CONCURRENT ENGINEERING** . Although the waterfall model is a useful tool for introducing design controls, its usefulness in practice is limited. The model does apply to the development of some simpler devices. However, for more complex devices, a concurrent engineering model is more representative of the design processes in use in the industry.', 'In a traditional waterfall development scenario, the engineering department completes the product design and formally transfers the design to production. Subsequently, other departments or organizations develop processes to manufacture and service the product. Historically, there has frequently been a divergence between the intent of the designer and the reality of the factory floor, resulting in such undesirable outcomes as low manufacturing yields, rework or redesign of the product, or unexpectedly high cost to service the product.', 'One benefit of concurrent engineering is the involvement of production and service personnel throughout the design process, assuring the mutual optimization of the characteristics of a device and its related processes. While the primary motivations of concurrent engineering are shorter development time and reduced production cost, the practical result is often improved product quality.', 'Concurrent engineering encompasses a range of practices and techniques. From a design control standpoint, it is sufficient to note that concurrent engineering may blur the line between development and production. On the one hand, the concurrent engineering model properly emphasizes that the development of production processes is a design rather than a manufacturing activity. On the other hand, various components of a design may enter production before the design as a whole has been approved. Thus, concurrent engineering and other more complex models of development usually require a comprehensive matrix of reviews and approvals to ensure that each component and process design is validated prior to entering production, and the product as a whole is validated prior to design release.', '**RISK MANAGEMENT AND DESIGN CONTROLS** . Risk management is the systematic application of management policies, procedures, and practices to the tasks of identifying, analyzing, controlling, and monitoring risk. It is intended to be a framework within which experience, insight, and judgment are applied to successfully manage risk. It is included in this guidance because of its effect on the design process.', 'Risk management begins with the development of the design input requirements. As the design evolves, new risks may become evident. To systematically identify and, when necessary, reduce these risks, the risk management process is integrated into the design process. In this way, unacceptable risks can be identified and managed earlier in the design process when changes are easier to make and less costly.', 'An example of this is an exposure control system for a general purpose x-ray system. The control function was allocated to software. Late in the development process, risk analysis of the system uncovered several failure modes that could result in overexposure to the patient. Because the problem was not identified until the design was near completion, an expensive, independent, back-up timer had to be added to monitor exposure times.', '**THE QUALITY SYSTEM AND DESIGN CONTROLS** . In addition to procedures and work instructions necessary for the implementation of design controls, policies and procedures may also be needed for other determinants of device quality that should be considered during the design process. The need for policies and procedures for these factors is dependent upon the types of devices manufactured by a company and the risks associated with their use. Management with executive responsibility has the responsibility for determining what is needed.', 'Example of topics for which policies and procedures may be appropriate are:\\n\\n  - risk management\\n\\n  - device reliability\\n\\n  - device durability\\n\\n  - device maintainability\\n\\n  - device serviceability\\n\\n  - human factors engineering\\n\\n  - software engineering\\n\\n  - use of standards\\n\\n  - configuration management\\n\\n  - compliance with regulatory requirements\\n\\n  - device evaluation (which may include third party product certification or approval)\\n\\n  - clinical evaluations\\n\\n  - document controls\\n\\n  - use of consultants\\n\\n  - use of subcontractors\\n\\n  - use of company historical data', '#### **SECTION A.

      "    \"- Design input requirements should be unambiguous. That is, each requirement should be able to be verified by an objective method of analysis, inspection, or testing. For example, it is insufficient to state that a catheter must be able to withstand repeated flexing. A better requirement would state that the catheter should be formed into a 50 mm diameter coil and straightened out for a total of fifty times with no evidence of cracking or deformity. A qualified reviewer could then make a judgment whether this specified test method is representative of the conditions of use.\",\n",
      "    \"- Quantitative limits should be expressed with a measurement tolerance. For example, a diameter of 3.5 mm is an incomplete specification. If the diameter is specified as 3.500±0.005 mm, designers have a basis for determining how accurate the manufacturing processes have to be to produce compliant parts, and reviewers have a basis for determining whether the parts will be suitable for the intended use.\",\n",
      "    \"- The set of design input requirements for a product should be self-consistent. It is not unusual for requirements to conflict with one another or with a referenced industry standard due to a simple oversight. Such conflicts should be resolved early in the development process.\",\n",
      "    \"Section C. Design Input 3/11/97 Page 17\",\n",
      "    \"- The environment in which the product is intended to be used should be properly characterized. For example, manufacturers frequently make the mistake of specifying “laboratory” conditions for devices which are intended for use in the home. Yet, even within a single country, relative humidity in a home may range from 20 percent to 100 percent (condensing) due to climactic and seasonal variations. Household temperatures in many climates routinely exceed 40 °C during the hot season. Altitudes may exceed 3,000 m, and the resultant low atmospheric pressure may adversely affect some kinds of medical equipment. If environmental conditions are fully specified, a qualified reviewer can make a determination of whether the specified conditions are representative of the intended use.\",\n",
      "    \"- When industry standards are cited, the citations should be reviewed for completeness and relevance. For example, one medical device manufacturer claimed compliance with an industry standard covering mechanical shock and vibration. However, when the referenced standard was examined by a reviewer, it was found to prescribe only the method of testing, omitting any mention of pass/fail criteria. It was incumbent on the manufacturer in this case to specify appropriate performance limits for the device being tested, as well as the test method.\",\n",
      "    \"**EVOLUTION OF THE DESIGN INPUT REQUIREMENTS** . Large development projects often are implemented in stages. When this occurs, the design input requirements at each stage should be developed and reviewed following the principles set forth in this section. Fortunately, the initial set of requirements, covering the overall product, is by far the most difficult to develop. As the design proceeds, the output from the early stages forms the basis for the subsequent stages, and the information available to designers is inherently more extensive and detailed.\",\n",
      "    \"It is almost inevitable that verification activities will uncover discrepancies which result in changes to the design input requirements. There are two points to be made about this. One is that the change control process for design input requirements must be carefully managed. Often, a design change to correct one problem may create a new problem which must be addressed.  Throughout the development process, it is important that any changes are documented and communicated to developers so that the total impact of the change can be determined. The change control process is crucial to device quality.\",\n",
      "    \"The second point is that extensive rework of the design input requirements suggests that the design input requirements may not be elaborated to a suitable level of detail, or insufficient resources are being devoted to defining and reviewing the requirements. Managers can use this insight to improve the design control process. From a design control perspective, the number of requirements changes made is less important than the thoroughness of the change control process.\",\n",

      "    \"The quality system requirements for design output can be separated into two elements: Design output should be expressed in terms that allow adequate assessment of conformance to design input requirements and should identify the characteristics of the design that are crucial to the safety and proper functioning of the device. This raises two fundamental issues for developers:\",\n",
      "    \"- What constitutes design output?\",\n",
      "    \"- Are the form and content of the design output suitable?\",\n",
      "    \"The first issue is important because the typical development project produces voluminous records, some of which may not be categorized as design output. On the other hand, design output must be reasonably comprehensive to be effective. As a general rule, an item is design output if it is a work product, or deliverable item, of a design task listed in\",\n",

      "    \"the design and development plan, and the item defines, describes, or elaborates an element of the design implementation. Examples include block diagrams, flow charts, software high-level code, and system or subsystem design specifications. The design output in one stage is often part of the design input in subsequent stages.\",\n",
      "    \"Design output includes production specifications as well as descriptive materials which define and characterize the design.\",\n",
      "    \"**PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS** . Production specifications include drawings and documents used to procure components, fabricate, test, inspect, install, maintain, and service the device, such as the following:\",\n",
      "    \"- assembly drawings\",\n",
      "    \"- component and material specifications\",\n",
      "    \"- production and process specifications\",\n",

      "    \"- installation and servicing procedures\",\n",
      "    \"- packaging and labeling specifications, including methods and processes used\",\n",
      "    \"In addition, as discussed in Section H (Design Transfer), production specifications may take on other forms. For example, some manufacturers produce assembly instructions on videotapes rather than written instructions. Similarly, a program diskette, used by a computer-aided milling machine to fabricate a part, would be considered a production specification. The videotape and the software on the program diskette are part of the device master record.\",\n",
      "    \"**OTHER DESCRIPTIVE MATERIALS** . Other design output items might be produced which are necessary to establish conformance to design input requirements, but are not used in its production. For example, for each part which is fabricated by computer-aided machine, there should be an assembly drawing which specifies the dimensions and characteristics of the part. It is a part of the design output because it establishes the basis for the machine tool program used to fabricate the part. Other examples of design output include the following:\",\n",
      "    \"- the results of risk analysis\",\n",
      "    \"- software source code\",\n",

      "    \"allow adequate verification and validation. Two basic mechanisms are available to manufacturers to accomplish these objectives.\",\n",
      "    \"- First, the manufacturer proactively can specify the form and content of design output at the planning stage. For some types of design output, form and content may be codified in a consensus standard which can be referenced. In other cases, a manufacturer could specify the desired characteristics, or even simply specify that the form and content of an existing document be followed.\",\n",
      "    \"- Second, form and content can be reviewed retroactively as a part of the design verification process. For example, the verification of design output could include assessing whether specified documentation standards have been adhered to.\",\n",

      "    \"In general, formal design reviews are intended to:\",\n",
      "    \"- provide a systematic assessment of design results, including the device design and the associated designs for production and support processes;\",\n",
      "    \"- provide feedback to designers on existing or emerging problems;\",\n",
      "    \"- assess project progress; and/or\",\n",
      "    \"- provide confirmation that the project is ready to move on to the next stage of development.\",\n",
      "    \"Many types of reviews occur during the course of developing a product. Reviews may have both an internal and external focus. The internal focus is on the feasibility of the design and the produceability of the design with respect to manufacturing and support\",\n",
      "    \"Section E. Design Review 3/11/97 Page 23\",\n",
      "    \"capabilities. The external focus is on the user requirements; that is, the device design is viewed from the perspective of the user.\",\n",
      "    \"The nature of reviews changes as the design progresses. During the initial stages, issues related to design input requirements will predominate. Next, the main function of the reviews may be to evaluate or confirm the choice of solutions being offered by the design team. Then, issues such as the choice of materials and the methods of manufacture become more important. During the final stages, issues related to the verification, validation, and production may predominate.\",\n",
      "    \"The term “review” is commonly used by manufacturers to describe a variety of design assessment activities. Most, but not all, of these activities meet the definition of formal design reviews. The following exceptions may help to clarify the distinguishing characteristics of design reviews.\",\n",
      "    \"- Each design document which constitutes the formal output, or deliverable, of a design task is normally subject to evaluation activities, sometimes referred to as informal peer review, supervisory review, or technical assessment. These activities, while they may be called reviews, are often better described as verification activities, because they are not intended to be comprehensive, definitive, and multidisciplinary in their scope. Rather, their purpose is to confirm that design output meets design input. Verification activities affect and add to the design output, and are themselves subject to subsequent design review.\",\n",
      "    \"- Developers may conduct routine or ad hoc meetings to discuss an issue, coordinate activities, or assess development progress. Decisions from such meetings may not require formal documentation; however, if a significant issue is resolved, this should be documented. If the outcome results in change to an approved design document, then applicable change control procedures should be followed, as discussed in Section I (Design Changes).\",\n",
      "    \"Control of the design review process is achieved by developing and implementing a formal design review program consistent with quality system requirements. The following issues should be addressed and documented in the design and development plan(s).\",\n",
      "    \"**NUMBER AND TYPE OF REVIEWS** . It is a well-accepted fact that the cost to correct design errors increases as the design nears completion, and the flexibility to implement an optimal solution decreases. When an error is discovered at the end of the development cycle, difficult decisions have to be made regarding an acceptable corrective action. When that corrective action is implemented in haste, the result is often an unintended consequence leading to a new problem. Thus, formal design reviews should be planned to detect problems early. A corollary is that planners should presume that problems will be detected, and allocate a reasonable amount of time to implement corrective actions. Typically, formal reviews are conducted at the end of each phase and at important milestones in the design process.\",\n",
      "    \"As discussed in Section C (Design Input), it is beneficial in almost every case to conduct a formal review of the design input requirements early in the development process. The number of reviews depends upon the complexity of the device.\",\n",
      "    \"- For a simple design, or a minor upgrade to an existing product, it might be appropriate to conduct a single review at the conclusion of the design process.\",\n",
      "    \"- For a product involving multiple subsystems, an early design task is to allocate the design input requirements among the various subsystems. For example, in a microprocessor-based system, designers must decide which functions will be performed by hardware and which by software. In another case, tolerance buildup from several components may combine to create a clearance problem. System designers must establish tolerance specifications for each component to meet the overall dimensional specification. In cases like these, a formal design review is a prudent step to ensure that all such system-level requirements have been allocated satisfactorily prior to engaging in detailed design of each subsystem.\",\n",
      "    \"- For complex systems, additional reviews are often built into the development plan. For example, engineering sketches may be developed for prototyping purposes prior to development of production drawings. Evaluation of the prototype would typically culminate in a formal design review. Similarly, software development commonly includes a high-level design phase, during which requirements are elaborated to a greater level of detail and algorithms are developed to implement key functions. A formal design review would typically be conducted to review this work prior to beginning detailed coding.\",\n",
      "    \"There are a number of approaches to conducting formal design reviews at the end of the design process. In some organizations, engineering essentially completes the design, tests an engineering prototype, and conducts a formal design review prior to turning the design over to manufacturing. In such cases, an additional review will be needed after the design has been validated using production devices.\",\n",
      "    \"In some instances, components having long lead times may enter production prior to completion of the overall device design. The primary motivation for early production is to reduce time to market. The manufacturer runs the business risk that the design review at the end of the design process will uncover a defect that must be corrected in production devices before any devices are distributed.\",\n",
      "    \"All of these approaches to scheduling formal design reviews are valid. What is important is that the manufacturer establish a reasonable rationale for the number and type of reviews, based on sound judgment.\",\n",
      "    \"**SELECTION OF REVIEWERS** . In determining who should participate in a formal design review, planners should consider the qualifications of reviewers, the types of expertise required to make an adequate assessment, and the independence of the reviewers. Each of these concerns is discussed briefly in the following paragraphs.\",\n",
      "    \"**Qualifications** . Formal design reviews should be conducted by person(s) having technical competence and experience at least comparable to the developers. For a small manufacturer, this may require that an outside consultant be retained to participate in the evaluation of the design.\",\n",
      "    \"A manufacturer will often employ one or more specialists to conduct certain types of specialized assessments which are beyond the capabilities of the designers. For example, a mechanical engineer may be retained to perform a structural analysis of a design, and perhaps conduct vibration testing to verify its performance under stress. Such specialists may be assigned to participate in the formal design review. Alternatively, they may be assigned to make an independent assessment and submit observations and recommendations to the reviewers. Either approach is valid.\",\n",
      "    \"**Types of expertise required** . Many medical device designs involve a number of technologies, such as electronics, mechanics, software, materials science, or pneumatics. In addition, a variety of clinical and manufacturing issues may influence the design. Manufacturers should carefully consider which interests should be represented at formal design reviews. Subtle distinctions in reviewer perspective may have dramatic impact on device quality. For example, the marketing department of a small manufacturer shared a new design with several surgeons on their advisory board. The surgeons all thought the design was terrific. Subsequently, the manufacturer invited two experienced operating room nurses to participate in the final design review. During the course of the review, it became apparent that while surgeons may be the customers, nurses are the primary users of the device, and no one up to that point had consulted with any nurses. The nurses at the design review didn’t like some of the features of the design. After some further market survey, the manufacturer decided to make changes to the design to accommodate these concerns. It was unfortunate (and expensive) in this case that the user requirements were not considered until late in the development cycle, but the design review was ultimately very successful.\",\n",
      "    \"**Independence** . The formal design review should include at least one individual who does not have direct responsibility for the design stage under review. In a small company, complete independence is very difficult to obtain. Within the context of formal design reviews, the practical solution is simply to ensure a fresh perspective, based on the principle that those who are too close to the design may overlook design errors. Thus, reviewers will often be from the same organization as the developers, but they should not have been significantly involved in the activities under review. As discussed in the following section, the formal design review procedures play a large role in assuring independent and objective reviews.\",\n",
      "    \"**DESIGN REVIEW PROCEDURES** . The manufacturer should have documented formal design review procedures addressing the following:\",\n",
      "    \"- Evaluation of the design (including identification of concerns, i.e., issues and potential problems with the design)\",\n",
      "    \"- Resolution of concerns\",\n",
      "    \"- Implementation of corrective actions\",\n",
      "    \"**Evaluation of the design** . Many formal design reviews take the form of a meeting. At this meeting, the designer(s) may make presentations to explain the design implementation, and persons responsible for verification activities may present their findings to the reviewers. Reviewers may ask for clarification or additional information on any topic, and add their concerns to any raised by the presenters. This portion of the review is focused on finding problems, not resolving them.\",\n",
      "    \"There are many approaches to conducting design review meetings. In simple cases, the technical assessor and reviewer may be the same person, often a project manager or engineering supervisor, and the review meeting is a simple affair in the manager’s office. For more elaborate reviews, detailed written procedures are desirable to ensure that all pertinent topics are discussed, conclusions accurately recorded, and action items documented and tracked.\",\n",
      "    \"There is a dangerous tendency for design review meetings to become adversarial affairs. The reputation of the designers tends to be linked to the number of discrepancies found, causing the designers to become defensive, while the reviewers score points by finding weaknesses in the design. The resulting contest can be counterproductive. An added complication is the presence of invited guests, often clinicians, who are expected to provide the user perspective. These reviewers are often very reluctant to ask probing questions, especially if they sense that they may become involved in a conflict where all the rules and relationships are not evident.\",\n",
      "    \"These difficulties can be avoided by stating the goals and ground rules for conducting the formal design review clearly at the outset. While the designers are in the best position to explain the best features of the design, they are also most likely to be aware of the design’s weaknesses. If the designers and reviewers are encouraged to work together to systematically explore problems and find solutions, the resultant design will be improved and all parties will benefit from the process. Participants must be encouraged to ask questions, avoid making assumptions, and think critically. The focus must be on the design, not the participants.\",\n",
      "    \"Not all formal design reviews involve meetings. For extremely simple designs or design changes, it may be appropriate to specify a procedure in which review materials are distributed or circulated among the reviewers for independent assessment and approval. However, such a procedure negates the benefits of synergy and teamwork, and should be considered only in cases where the design issues are limited in scope and well defined.\",\n",
      "    \"**Resolution of concerns** . The reviewers consider concerns raised during the evaluation portion of the formal design review and decide on an appropriate disposition for each one. There is wide variation in the way companies implement decision-making processes. In some cases, the reviewers play an advisory role to the engineering manager or other company official, who directs the formal design review and ultimately selects a course of\"\n",

That is, each requirement should be able to be verified by an objective method of analysis, inspection, or testing. For example, it is insufficient to state that a catheter must be able to withstand repeated flexing. A better requirement would state that the catheter should be formed into a 50 mm diameter coil and straightened out for a total of fifty times with no evidence of cracking or deformity. A qualified reviewer could then make a judgment whether this specified test method is representative of the conditions of use.', '- Quantitative limits should be expressed with a measurement tolerance. For example, a diameter of 3.5 mm is an incomplete specification. If the diameter is specified as 3.500±0.005 mm, designers have a basis for determining how accurate the manufacturing processes have to be to produce compliant parts, and reviewers have a basis for determining whether the parts will be suitable for the intended use.', '- The set of design input requirements for a product should be self-consistent. It is not unusual for requirements to conflict with one another or with a referenced industry standard due to a simple oversight. Such conflicts should be resolved early in the development process.', 'Section C. Design Input 3/11/97 Page 17', '- The environment in which the product is intended to be used should be properly characterized. For example, manufacturers frequently make the mistake of specifying “laboratory” conditions for devices which are intended for use in the home. Yet, even within a single country, relative humidity in a home may range from 20 percent to 100 percent (condensing) due to climactic and seasonal variations. Household temperatures in many climates routinely exceed 40 °C during the hot season. Altitudes may exceed 3,000 m, and the resultant low atmospheric pressure may adversely affect some kinds of medical equipment. If environmental conditions are fully specified, a qualified reviewer can make a determination of whether the specified conditions are representative of the intended use.', '- When industry standards are cited, the citations should be reviewed for completeness and relevance. For example, one medical device manufacturer claimed compliance with an industry standard covering mechanical shock and vibration. However, when the referenced standard was examined by a reviewer, it was found to prescribe only the method of testing, omitting any mention of pass/fail criteria. It was incumbent on the manufacturer in this case to specify appropriate performance limits for the device being tested, as well as the test method.', '**EVOLUTION OF THE DESIGN INPUT REQUIREMENTS** . Large development projects often are implemented in stages. When this occurs, the design input requirements at each stage should be developed and reviewed following the principles set forth in this section. Fortunately, the initial set of requirements, covering the overall product, is by far the most difficult to develop. As the design proceeds, the output from the early stages forms the basis for the subsequent stages, and the information available to designers is inherently more extensive and detailed.', 'It is almost inevitable that verification activities will uncover discrepancies which result in changes to the design input requirements. There are two points to be made about this. One is that the change control process for design input requirements must be carefully managed. Often, a design change to correct one problem may create a new problem which must be addressed.  Throughout the development process, it is important that any changes are documented and communicated to developers so that the total impact of the change can be determined. The change control process is crucial to device quality.', 'The second point is that extensive rework of the design input requirements suggests that the design input requirements may not be elaborated to a suitable level of detail, or insufficient resources are being devoted to defining and reviewing the requirements. Managers can use this insight to improve the design control process. From a design control perspective, the number of requirements changes made is less important than the thoroughness of the change control process.', 'Section C.

DISCUSSION AND POINTS TO CONSIDER_', 'The quality system requirements for design output can be separated into two elements: Design output should be expressed in terms that allow adequate assessment of conformance to design input requirements and should identify the characteristics of the design that are crucial to the safety and proper functioning of the device. This raises two fundamental issues for developers:', '- What constitutes design output?', '- Are the form and content of the design output suitable?', 'The first issue is important because the typical development project produces voluminous records, some of which may not be categorized as design output. On the other hand, design output must be reasonably comprehensive to be effective. As a general rule, an item is design output if it is a work product, or deliverable item, of a design task listed in', 'Section D. Design Output 3/11/97 Page 19', 'the design and development plan, and the item defines, describes, or elaborates an element of the design implementation. Examples include block diagrams, flow charts, software high-level code, and system or subsystem design specifications. The design output in one stage is often part of the design input in subsequent stages.', 'Design output includes production specifications as well as descriptive materials which define and characterize the design.', '**PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS** . Production specifications include drawings and documents used to procure components, fabricate, test, inspect, install, maintain, and service the device, such as the following:', '- assembly drawings', '- component and material specifications', '- production and process specifications', '- software machine code (e.g., diskette or master EPROM)', '- work instructions', '- quality assurance specifications and procedures', '- installation and servicing procedures', '- packaging and labeling specifications, including methods and processes used', 'In addition, as discussed in Section H (Design Transfer), production specifications may take on other forms. For example, some manufacturers produce assembly instructions on videotapes rather than written instructions. Similarly, a program diskette, used by a computer-aided milling machine to fabricate a part, would be considered a production specification. The videotape and the software on the program diskette are part of the device master record.', '**OTHER DESCRIPTIVE MATERIALS** . Other design output items might be produced which are necessary to establish conformance to design input requirements, but are not used in its production. For example, for each part which is fabricated by computer-aided machine, there should be an assembly drawing which specifies the dimensions and characteristics of the part. It is a part of the design output because it establishes the basis for the machine tool program used to fabricate the part. Other examples of design output include the following:', '- the results of risk analysis', '- software source code', '- results of verification activities', '- biocompatibility test results', '- bioburden test results', '**FORM AND CONTENT** . Manufacturers must take steps to assure that the design output characterizes all important aspects of the design and is expressed in terms which', 'Section D. Design Output 3/11/97 Page 20', 'allow adequate verification and validation. Two basic mechanisms are available to manufacturers to accomplish these objectives.', '- First, the manufacturer proactively can specify the form and content of design output at the planning stage. For some types of design output, form and content may be codified in a consensus standard which can be referenced. In other cases, a manufacturer could specify the desired characteristics, or even simply specify that the form and content of an existing document be followed.', '- Second, form and content can be reviewed retroactively as a part of the design verification process. For example, the verification of design output could include assessing whether specified documentation standards have been adhered to.', 'As these examples illustrate, conformance with the quality system requirements concerning design output generally requires no “extra” effort on the part of the manufacturer, but simply the application of some common sense procedures during the planning, execution, and review of design tasks.', 'Section D.

Reviews may have both an internal and external focus. The internal focus is on the feasibility of the design and the produceability of the design with respect to manufacturing and support', 'Section E. Design Review 3/11/97 Page 23', 'capabilities. The external focus is on the user requirements; that is, the device design is viewed from the perspective of the user.', 'The nature of reviews changes as the design progresses. During the initial stages, issues related to design input requirements will predominate. Next, the main function of the reviews may be to evaluate or confirm the choice of solutions being offered by the design team. Then, issues such as the choice of materials and the methods of manufacture become more important. During the final stages, issues related to the verification, validation, and production may predominate.', 'The term “review” is commonly used by manufacturers to describe a variety of design assessment activities. Most, but not all, of these activities meet the definition of formal design reviews. The following exceptions may help to clarify the distinguishing characteristics of design reviews.', '- Each design document which constitutes the formal output, or deliverable, of a design task is normally subject to evaluation activities, sometimes referred to as informal peer review, supervisory review, or technical assessment. These activities, while they may be called reviews, are often better described as verification activities, because they are not intended to be comprehensive, definitive, and multidisciplinary in their scope. Rather, their purpose is to confirm that design output meets design input. Verification activities affect and add to the design output, and are themselves subject to subsequent design review.', '- Developers may conduct routine or ad hoc meetings to discuss an issue, coordinate activities, or assess development progress. Decisions from such meetings may not require formal documentation; however, if a significant issue is resolved, this should be documented. If the outcome results in change to an approved design document, then applicable change control procedures should be followed, as discussed in Section I (Design Changes).', 'Control of the design review process is achieved by developing and implementing a formal design review program consistent with quality system requirements. The following issues should be addressed and documented in the design and development plan(s).', '**NUMBER AND TYPE OF REVIEWS** . It is a well-accepted fact that the cost to correct design errors increases as the design nears completion, and the flexibility to implement an optimal solution decreases. When an error is discovered at the end of the development cycle, difficult decisions have to be made regarding an acceptable corrective action. When that corrective action is implemented in haste, the result is often an unintended consequence leading to a new problem. Thus, formal design reviews should be planned to detect problems early. A corollary is that planners should presume that problems will be detected, and allocate a reasonable amount of time to implement corrective actions. Typically, formal reviews are conducted at the end of each phase and at important milestones in the design process.', 'As discussed in Section C (Design Input), it is beneficial in almost every case to conduct a formal review of the design input requirements early in the development process. The number of reviews depends upon the complexity of the device.', '- For a simple design, or a minor upgrade to an existing product, it might be appropriate to conduct a single review at the conclusion of the design process.', '- For a product involving multiple subsystems, an early design task is to allocate the design input requirements among the various subsystems. For example, in a microprocessor-based system, designers must decide which functions will be performed by hardware and which by software. In another case, tolerance buildup from several components may combine to create a clearance problem. System designers must establish tolerance specifications for each component to meet the overall dimensional specification. In cases like these, a formal design review is a prudent step to ensure that all such system-level requirements have been allocated satisfactorily prior to engaging in detailed design of each subsystem.', '- For complex systems, additional reviews are often built into the development plan. For example, engineering sketches may be developed for prototyping purposes prior to development of production drawings. Evaluation of the prototype would typically culminate in a formal design review. Similarly, software development commonly includes a high-level design phase, during which requirements are elaborated to a greater level of detail and algorithms are developed to implement key functions. A formal design review would typically be conducted to review this work prior to beginning detailed coding.', 'There are a number of approaches to conducting formal design reviews at the end of the design process. In some organizations, engineering essentially completes the design, tests an engineering prototype, and conducts a formal design review prior to turning the design over to manufacturing. In such cases, an additional review will be needed after the design has been validated using production devices.', 'In some instances, components having long lead times may enter production prior to completion of the overall device design. The primary motivation for early production is to reduce time to market. The manufacturer runs the business risk that the design review at the end of the design process will uncover a defect that must be corrected in production devices before any devices are distributed.', 'All of these approaches to scheduling formal design reviews are valid. What is important is that the manufacturer establish a reasonable rationale for the number and type of reviews, based on sound judgment.', '**SELECTION OF REVIEWERS** . In determining who should participate in a formal design review, planners should consider the qualifications of reviewers, the types of expertise required to make an adequate assessment, and the independence of the reviewers. Each of these concerns is discussed briefly in the following paragraphs.', '**Qualifications** . Formal design reviews should be conducted by person(s) having technical competence and experience at least comparable to the developers. For a small manufacturer, this may require that an outside consultant be retained to participate in the evaluation of the design.', 'A manufacturer will often employ one or more specialists to conduct certain types of specialized assessments which are beyond the capabilities of the designers. For example, a mechanical engineer may be retained to perform a structural analysis of a design, and perhaps conduct vibration testing to verify its performance under stress. Such specialists may be assigned to participate in the formal design review. Alternatively, they may be assigned to make an independent assessment and submit observations and recommendations to the reviewers. Either approach is valid.', '**Types of expertise required** . Many medical device designs involve a number of technologies, such as electronics, mechanics, software, materials science, or pneumatics. In addition, a variety of clinical and manufacturing issues may influence the design. Manufacturers should carefully consider which interests should be represented at formal design reviews. Subtle distinctions in reviewer perspective may have dramatic impact on device quality. For example, the marketing department of a small manufacturer shared a new design with several surgeons on their advisory board. The surgeons all thought the design was terrific. Subsequently, the manufacturer invited two experienced operating room nurses to participate in the final design review. During the course of the review, it became apparent that while surgeons may be the customers, nurses are the primary users of the device, and no one up to that point had consulted with any nurses. The nurses at the design review didn’t like some of the features of the design. After some further market survey, the manufacturer decided to make changes to the design to accommodate these concerns. It was unfortunate (and expensive) in this case that the user requirements were not considered until late in the development cycle, but the design review was ultimately very successful.', '**Independence** . The formal design review should include at least one individual who does not have direct responsibility for the design stage under review. In a small company, complete independence is very difficult to obtain. Within the context of formal design reviews, the practical solution is simply to ensure a fresh perspective, based on the principle that those who are too close to the design may overlook design errors. Thus, reviewers will often be from the same organization as the developers, but they should not have been significantly involved in the activities under review. As discussed in the following section, the formal design review procedures play a large role in assuring independent and objective reviews.', '**DESIGN REVIEW PROCEDURES** . The manufacturer should have documented formal design review procedures addressing the following:', '- Evaluation of the design (including identification of concerns, i.e., issues and potential problems with the design)', '- Resolution of concerns', '- Implementation of corrective actions', '**Evaluation of the design** . Many formal design reviews take the form of a meeting. At this meeting, the designer(s) may make presentations to explain the design implementation, and persons responsible for verification activities may present their findings to the reviewers. Reviewers may ask for clarification or additional information on any topic, and add their concerns to any raised by the presenters. This portion of the review is focused on finding problems, not resolving them.', 'There are many approaches to conducting design review meetings. In simple cases, the technical assessor and reviewer may be the same person, often a project manager or engineering supervisor, and the review meeting is a simple affair in the manager’s office. For more elaborate reviews, detailed written procedures are desirable to ensure that all pertinent topics are discussed, conclusions accurately recorded, and action items documented and tracked.', 'There is a dangerous tendency for design review meetings to become adversarial affairs. The reputation of the designers tends to be linked to the number of discrepancies found, causing the designers to become defensive, while the reviewers score points by finding weaknesses in the design. The resulting contest can be counterproductive. An added complication is the presence of invited guests, often clinicians, who are expected to provide the user perspective. These reviewers are often very reluctant to ask probing questions, especially if they sense that they may become involved in a conflict where all the rules and relationships are not evident.', 'These difficulties can be avoided by stating the goals and ground rules for conducting the formal design review clearly at the outset. While the designers are in the best position to explain the best features of the design, they are also most likely to be aware of the design’s weaknesses. If the designers and reviewers are encouraged to work together to systematically explore problems and find solutions, the resultant design will be improved and all parties will benefit from the process. Participants must be encouraged to ask questions, avoid making assumptions, and think critically. The focus must be on the design, not the participants.', 'Not all formal design reviews involve meetings. For extremely simple designs or design changes, it may be appropriate to specify a procedure in which review materials are distributed or circulated among the reviewers for independent assessment and approval. However, such a procedure negates the benefits of synergy and teamwork, and should be considered only in cases where the design issues are limited in scope and well defined.', '**Resolution of concerns** . The reviewers consider concerns raised during the evaluation portion of the formal design review and decide on an appropriate disposition for each one. There is wide variation in the way companies implement decision-making processes. In some cases, the reviewers play an advisory role to the engineering manager or other company official, who directs the formal design review and ultimately selects a course of']}\n",

      "    \"**Implementation of corrective actions** . Not all identified concerns result in corrective actions. The reviewers may decide that the issue is erroneous or immaterial. In most cases, however, resolution involves a design change, a requirements change, or a combination of the two. If the solution is evident, the reviewers may specify the appropriate corrective action; otherwise, an action item will be assigned to study the problem further. In any case, action items and corrective actions are normally tracked under the manufacturer’s change control procedures.\",\n",
      "    \"**RELATIONSHIP OF DESIGN REVIEW TO VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION** . In practice, design review, verification, and validation overlap one another, and the relationship among them may be confusing. As a general rule, the sequence is: verification, review, validation, review.\",\n",
      "    \"In most cases, verification activities are completed prior to the design review, and the verification results are submitted to the reviewers along with the other design output to be reviewed.

      "    \"Verification and validation are associated concepts with very important differences. Various organizations have different definitions for these terms. Medical device manufacturers are encouraged to use the terminology of the quality system requirements in their internal procedures.\",\n",
      "    \"To illustrate the concepts, consider a building design analogy. In a typical scenario, the senior architect establishes the design input requirements and sketches the general appearance and construction of the building, but associates or contractors typically elaborate the details of the various mechanical systems. Verification is the process of checking at each stage whether the output conforms to requirements for that stage. For example: does the air conditioning system deliver the specified cooling capacity to each room? Is the roof rated to withstand so many newtons per square meter of wind loading? Is a fire alarm located within 50 meters of each location in the building?\",\n",
      "    \"At the same time, the architect has to keep in mind the broader question of whether the results are consistent with the ultimate user requirements. Does the air conditioning system keep the occupants comfortable throughout the building? Will the roof withstand weather extremes expected at the building site? Can the fire alarm be heard throughout the building? Those broader concerns are the essence of validation.\",\n",
      "    \"In the initial stages of design, verification is a key quality assurance technique. As the design effort progresses, verification activities become progressively more comprehensive. For example, heat or cooling delivery can be calculated and verified by the air conditioning designer, but the resultant air temperature can only be estimated. Occupant comfort is a function not only of delivered air temperature, but also humidity, heat radiation to or from nearby thermal masses, heat gain or loss through adjacent windows, etc. During the latter design phases, the interaction of these complex factors may be considered during verification of the design.\",\n",
      "    \"Validation follows successful verification, and ensures that each requirement for a particular use is fulfilled. Validation of user needs is possible only after the building is built. The air conditioning and fire alarm performance may be validated by testing and inspection, while the strength of the roof will probably be validated by some sort of analysis linked to building codes which are accepted as meeting the needs of the user—subject to possible confirmation during a subsequent severe storm.\",\n",
      "    \"Validation is the topic of Section G of this guidance document. The remainder of this section focuses on verification principles.\",\n",
      "    \"**TYPES OF VERIFICATION ACTIVITIES** . Verification activities are conducted at all stages and levels of device design. The basis of verification is a three-pronged approach involving tests, inspections, and analyses. Any approach which establishes conformance with a design input requirement is an acceptable means of verifying the design with respect to that requirement. In many cases, a variety of approaches are possible.\",\n",
      "    \"Complex designs require more and different types of verification activities. The nature of verification activities varies according to the type of design output. The intent of this guidance document is not to suggest or recommend verification techniques which should be performed by device manufacturers. Rather, the manufacturer should select and apply appropriate verification techniques based on the generally accepted practices for the technologies employed in their products. Many of these practices are an integral part of the development process, and are routinely performed by developers. The objective of design controls is to ensure adequate oversight by making verification activities explicit and measuring the thoroughness of their execution. Following are a few examples of verification methods and activities.\",\n",
      "    \"- Worst case analysis of an assembly to verify that components are derated properly and not subject to overstress during handling and use.\",\n",
      "    \"- Thermal analysis of an assembly to assure that internal or surface temperatures do not exceed specified limits.\",\n",
      "    \"- Fault tree analysis of a process or design.\",\n",
      "    \"- Failure modes and effects analysis.\",\n",
      "    \"- Package integrity tests.\",\n",
      "    \"- Biocompatibility testing of materials.\",\n",
      "    \"- Bioburden testing of products to be sterilized.\",\n",
      "    \"- Comparison of a design to a previous product having an established history of successful use.\",\n",
      "    \"For some technologies, verification methods may be highly standardized. In other cases, the manufacturer may choose from a variety of applicable methods. In a few cases, the manufacturer must be creative in devising ways to verify a particular aspect of a design.\",\n",
      "    \"Some manufacturers erroneously equate production testing with verification. Whereas verification testing establishes conformance of design output with design input, the aim of production testing is to determine whether the unit under test has been correctly manufactured. In other words, production testing is designed to efficiently screen out manufacturing process errors and perhaps also to detect infant mortality failures. Typically, a small subset of functional and performance tests accomplish this objective with a high degree of accuracy. Therefore, production testing is rarely, if ever, comprehensive enough to verify the design. For example, a leakage test may be used during production to ensure that a hermetically-sealed enclosure was properly assembled. However, the leakage test may not be sensitive enough to detect long-term diffusion of gas through the packaging material.  Permeability of the packaging material is an intrinsic property of the material rather than an assembly issue, and would likely be verified using a more specialized test than is used during production.\",\n",
      "    \"**DOCUMENTATION OF VERIFICATION ACTIVITIES** . Some verification methods result in a document by their nature. For example, a failure modes and effects analysis produces a table listing each system component, its postulated failure modes, and the effect of such failures on system operation.\",\n",
      "    \"Another self-documenting verification method is the traceability matrix. This method is particularly useful when the design input and output are both documents; it also has great utility in software development. In the most common form of the traceability matrix, the input requirements are enumerated in a table, and references are provided to each section in the output documents (or software modules) which address or satisfy each input requirement. The matrix can also be constructed “backwards,” listing each feature in the design output and tracing which input requirement bears on that feature. This reverse approach is especially useful for detecting hidden assumptions. Hidden assumptions are dangerous because they often lead to overdesign, adding unnecessary cost and complexity to the design. In other cases, hidden assumptions turn out to be undocumented design input requirements which, once exposed, can be properly tracked and verified.\",\n",
      "    \"However, many verification activities are simply some sort of structured assessment of the design output relative to the design input. When this is the case, manufacturers may document completion of verification activities by linking these activities with the signoff procedures for documents. This may be accomplished by establishing a procedure whereby each design output document must be verified and signed by designated persons. The presence of the reviewers’ signatures on the document signifies that the design output has been verified in accordance with the signoff procedure.\",\n",

In any case, action items and corrective actions are normally tracked under the manufacturer’s change control procedures.', '**RELATIONSHIP OF DESIGN REVIEW TO VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION** . In practice, design review, verification, and validation overlap one another, and the relationship among them may be confusing. As a general rule, the sequence is: verification, review, validation, review.', 'In most cases, verification activities are completed prior to the design review, and the verification results are submitted to the reviewers along with the other design output to be reviewed. Alternatively, some verification activities may be treated as components of the design review, particularly if the verification activity is complex and requires multidisciplinary review.', 'Similarly, validation typically involves a variety of activities, including a determination that the appropriate verifications and reviews have been completed. Thus, at the conclusion of the validation effort, a review is usually warranted to assure that the validation is complete and adequate.', 'Section E.

DISCUSSION AND POINTS TO CONSIDER_', 'Verification and validation are associated concepts with very important differences. Various organizations have different definitions for these terms. Medical device manufacturers are encouraged to use the terminology of the quality system requirements in their internal procedures.', 'To illustrate the concepts, consider a building design analogy. In a typical scenario, the senior architect establishes the design input requirements and sketches the general appearance and construction of the building, but associates or contractors typically elaborate the details of the various mechanical systems. Verification is the process of checking at each stage whether the output conforms to requirements for that stage. For example: does the air conditioning system deliver the specified cooling capacity to each room? Is the roof rated to withstand so many newtons per square meter of wind loading? Is a fire alarm located within 50 meters of each location in the building?', 'At the same time, the architect has to keep in mind the broader question of whether the results are consistent with the ultimate user requirements. Does the air conditioning system keep the occupants comfortable throughout the building? Will the roof withstand weather extremes expected at the building site? Can the fire alarm be heard throughout the building? Those broader concerns are the essence of validation.', 'In the initial stages of design, verification is a key quality assurance technique. As the design effort progresses, verification activities become progressively more comprehensive. For example, heat or cooling delivery can be calculated and verified by the air conditioning designer, but the resultant air temperature can only be estimated. Occupant comfort is a function not only of delivered air temperature, but also humidity, heat radiation to or from nearby thermal masses, heat gain or loss through adjacent windows, etc. During the latter design phases, the interaction of these complex factors may be considered during verification of the design.', 'Validation follows successful verification, and ensures that each requirement for a particular use is fulfilled. Validation of user needs is possible only after the building is built. The air conditioning and fire alarm performance may be validated by testing and inspection, while the strength of the roof will probably be validated by some sort of analysis linked to building codes which are accepted as meeting the needs of the user—subject to possible confirmation during a subsequent severe storm.', 'Validation is the topic of Section G of this guidance document. The remainder of this section focuses on verification principles.', '**TYPES OF VERIFICATION ACTIVITIES** . Verification activities are conducted at all stages and levels of device design. The basis of verification is a three-pronged approach involving tests, inspections, and analyses. Any approach which establishes conformance with a design input requirement is an acceptable means of verifying the design with respect to that requirement. In many cases, a variety of approaches are possible.', 'Complex designs require more and different types of verification activities. The nature of verification activities varies according to the type of design output. The intent of this guidance document is not to suggest or recommend verification techniques which should be performed by device manufacturers. Rather, the manufacturer should select and apply appropriate verification techniques based on the generally accepted practices for the technologies employed in their products. Many of these practices are an integral part of the development process, and are routinely performed by developers. The objective of design controls is to ensure adequate oversight by making verification activities explicit and measuring the thoroughness of their execution. Following are a few examples of verification methods and activities.', '- Worst case analysis of an assembly to verify that components are derated properly and not subject to overstress during handling and use.', '- Thermal analysis of an assembly to assure that internal or surface temperatures do not exceed specified limits.', '- Fault tree analysis of a process or design.', '- Failure modes and effects analysis.', '- Package integrity tests.', '- Biocompatibility testing of materials.', '- Bioburden testing of products to be sterilized.', '- Comparison of a design to a previous product having an established history of successful use.', 'For some technologies, verification methods may be highly standardized. In other cases, the manufacturer may choose from a variety of applicable methods. In a few cases, the manufacturer must be creative in devising ways to verify a particular aspect of a design.', 'Some manufacturers erroneously equate production testing with verification. Whereas verification testing establishes conformance of design output with design input, the aim of production testing is to determine whether the unit under test has been correctly manufactured. In other words, production testing is designed to efficiently screen out manufacturing process errors and perhaps also to detect infant mortality failures. Typically, a small subset of functional and performance tests accomplish this objective with a high degree of accuracy. Therefore, production testing is rarely, if ever, comprehensive enough to verify the design. For example, a leakage test may be used during production to ensure that a hermetically-sealed enclosure was properly assembled. However, the leakage test may not be sensitive enough to detect long-term diffusion of gas through the packaging material.  Permeability of the packaging material is an intrinsic property of the material rather than an assembly issue, and would likely be verified using a more specialized test than is used during production.', '**DOCUMENTATION OF VERIFICATION ACTIVITIES** . Some verification methods result in a document by their nature. For example, a failure modes and effects analysis produces a table listing each system component, its postulated failure modes, and the effect of such failures on system operation.', 'Another self-documenting verification method is the traceability matrix. This method is particularly useful when the design input and output are both documents; it also has great utility in software development. In the most common form of the traceability matrix, the input requirements are enumerated in a table, and references are provided to each section in the output documents (or software modules) which address or satisfy each input requirement. The matrix can also be constructed “backwards,” listing each feature in the design output and tracing which input requirement bears on that feature. This reverse approach is especially useful for detecting hidden assumptions. Hidden assumptions are dangerous because they often lead to overdesign, adding unnecessary cost and complexity to the design. In other cases, hidden assumptions turn out to be undocumented design input requirements which, once exposed, can be properly tracked and verified.', 'However, many verification activities are simply some sort of structured assessment of the design output relative to the design input. When this is the case, manufacturers may document completion of verification activities by linking these activities with the signoff procedures for documents. This may be accomplished by establishing a procedure whereby each design output document must be verified and signed by designated persons. The presence of the reviewers’ signatures on the document signifies that the design output has been verified in accordance with the signoff procedure.', 'Section F.

      "    \"**iii**\\n\\nMEDICAL DEVICE REGULATIONS\\n\\n##### **Foreword**\\n\\nThe term _medical devices_ covers a vast range of equipment, from simple tongue depressors\\nto haemodialysis machines. Like medicines and other health technologies, they are essential\\nfor patient care – at the bedside, at the rural health clinic or at the large, specialized\\nhospital.\",\n",
      "    \"Medical devices also cost governments a substantial amount of money. In 2000, the\\nestimated one and a half million different medical devices available on the market\\nrepresented over US$145 billion. With innovation and the rapid advancement of\\ntechnologies, medical devices are currently one of the fastest growing industries, and the\\nglobal market figure for 2006 is expected to exceed US$260 billion.\",\n",
      "    \"Yet many countries lack access to high-quality devices and equipment that are\\nappropriate for their specific epidemiological needs. This is particularly true in developing\\ncountries, where health technology assessments are rare and where little regulatory controls\\nexist to prevent the importation or use of substandard devices. With the vast majority of\\ndevices in developing countries being imported, this leaves them prey to unscrupulous\\nmarket influences and puts patients’ lives at risk.\",\n",
      "    \"Governments need to put in place policies that will address all elements related to\\nmedical devices, ranging from access to high quality, affordable products, through to\\ntheir safe and appropriate use and disposal. The health technology life cycle diagram\\n(back cover) illustrates the policy process that needs to be in place. However, policies will\\nbe unsuccessful unless they are translated into national regulations that are enforced by\\nlegislation and correlating sanctions, and that form an integral part of the overall national\\nhealth system.\",\n",
      "    \"Surprisingly, regulatory controls for medical devices are scarce in the developing world,\\neven though implementation of national medical device regulations will often address the\\nvery issues raised in countries as major concerns for patient safety. Examples of these\\nissues include the illegal re-processing and re-packaging of used syringes for re-sale; the\\navailability on the market of equipment that fails minimum quality and safety standards;\\nor simply no trace of what devices are being sold in the country, nor by whom. Such a\\nlisting is essential to enable governments to issue alerts or recalls for unsafe or ineffective\\nitems.\",\n",
      "    \"The purpose of this publication is to provide guidance to Member States wishing to\\ncreate or modify their own regulatory systems for medical devices. It is recognized that\\nthere is no single template that will respond to the needs of every country. Some countries\\nmay have production facilities that will require good manufacturing practice and complex\\nquality controls; others may depend principally on the donation of equipment from external\\nsources and need different policies to protect their population against unsafe and\\ninappropriate technology. Resources, both human and financial, remain a significant factor\\nin the progressive development of national regulatory authorities. Nevertheless, there are\\nmany ways that governments can benefit from the wealth of experience of others, and\",\n",
      "    \"start to build efficient medical device regulatory systems. This publication highlights the\\nmost important of these.\\nIn essence, governments are encouraged to follow the growing movement towards\\nharmonized regulatory systems because a proliferation of different national regulations\\nincreases costs, hinders access to health care technologies, and can even unwittingly\\njeopardize the safety of the patient.\",\n",
      "    \"Secondly, Member States can adopt where appropriate the device approvals of the\\nadvanced regulatory systems, since this process represents a vast, and often unnecessary\\ndrain on scarce resources.\",\n",
      "    \"This will allow countries with weak regulatory systems to place emphasis and initial\\nresources on areas such as vendor and device registration, training, and surveillance and\\ninformation exchange systems on the assessment of medical devices in use.\\nWHO is reinforcing its role in providing technical support to Member States who wish\\nto implement improved medical device regulatory systems. We hope that this guide provides\\na useful framework within which countries can assess and address their needs to protect\\ntheir populations from the risks of unsafe technology.\",\n",

Lepakhin_\\n\\nAssistant Director-General\\n\\nHealth Technology and Pharmaceuticals\\n\\n**vi**\\n\\nMEDICAL DEVICE REGULATIONS\\n\\n##### **Glossary**\\n\\n**Note on the definition of medical devices**\\n\\nThe term “medical devices” includes everything from highly sophisticated computerized\\nmedical equipment down to simple wooden tongue depressors. The intended primary\\nmode of action of a medical device on the human body, in contrast with that of medicinal\\nproducts, is not metabolic, immunological, or pharmacological.\",\n",
      "    \"Several different international classification systems for medical devices are still in use\\nin the world today. The World Health Organization, with its partners, is working towards\\nachieving harmonization in medical device nomenclature, which will have a significant\\nimpact on patient safety (see section 4.5). This is particularly important to be able to\\nidentify adverse incident reports and recalls.\",\n",
      "    \"The Global Harmonization Task Force has proposed the following harmonized definition\\nfor medical devices (see GHTF document SG1/N029R11).\\n\\n“Medical device” means any instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, appliance,\\nimplant, _in vitro_ reagent or calibrator, software, material or other similar or related\\narticle, intended by the manufacturer to be used, alone or in combination, for human\\nbeings for one or more of the specific purposes of:\\n\\n   - diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease\\n\\n   - diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury\\n\\n   - investigation, replacement, modification, or support of the anatomy or of a\\nphysiological process\\n\\n   - supporting or sustaining life\\n\\n   - control of conception\\n\\n   - disinfection of medical devices\\n\\n   - providing information for medical purposes by means of _in vitro_ examination of\\nspecimens derived from the human body and which does not achieve its primary\\nintended action in or on the human body by pharmacological, immunological or\\nmetabolic means, but which may be assisted in its function by such means.\",\n",
      "    \"_Note:_ An accessory is not considered to be a medical device. However, where an\\naccessory is intended specifically by its manufacturer to be used together with the\\n‘parent’ medical device to enable the medical device to achieve its intended purpose,\\nit should be subject to the same procedures and GHTF guidance documents as apply\\nto the medical device itself.\",\n",
      "    \"_Note:_ The definition of a device for _in vitro_ examination includes, for example,\\nreagents, calibrators, sample collection devices, control materials, and related\\ninstruments or apparatus.

      "    \"**2.1 Medical device safety and risk management**\\nSafety can only be considered in relative terms. All devices carry a certain degree of risk\\nand could cause problems in specific circumstances. Many medical device problems cannot\\nbe detected until extensive market experience is gained. For example, an implantable\\ndevice may fail in a manner that was not predictable at the time of implantation; the\\nfailure may reflect conditions unique to certain patients. For other devices, component\\nfailure can also be unpredictable or random. The current approach to device safety is to\\nestimate the potential of a device becoming a hazard that could result in safety problems\\nand harm. This estimate is often referred to as the _**risk assessment**_ .\",\n",
      "    \"Hazard is a potential for an adverse event, a source of danger. Risk is a measure of the\\ncombination of (1) the hazard; (2) the likelihood of occurrence of the adverse event; (3)\\nthe severity or overall impact. Risk assessment begins with _**risk analysis**_ to identify all\\npossible hazards, followed by _**risk evaluation**_ to estimate the risk of each hazard. In\\ngeneral, risk assessment is based on experience, evidence, computation, or even guesswork.\\nRisk assessment is complex, as it can be influenced by personal perception and other\\nfactors such as cultural background, economic conditions, and political climates.\",\n",
      "    \"In practice, risk assessment of medical devices is based on the experience of health care\\nprofessionals and on safety design engineering. In the United States, governmental risk\\nassessment of medical devices is based mainly on recommendations from members of 16\\nmedical specialty panels, and devices are categorized into three classes. In the European\\nUnion and Canada, the classification schemes for medical devices are predominantly rulebased. These rules categorize medical devices according to their perceived potential hazards.\",\n",
      "    \"Canada assigns four classes of devices. The European Union assigns three classes with\\nclass II being sub-divided into IIa and IIb (effectively, also four classes). The Global\\nHarmonization Task Force (GHTF) is proposing a harmonized scheme for medical device\\nclassification (see www.GHTF.org document SG1/N015R18).\",\n",
      "    \"In classifying devices, potential areas of hazard that warrant consideration include the\\ndegree of invasiveness, duration of contact, the body system affected, and local versus\\nsystemic effects. An invasive device is usually considered to have higher potential hazard\\nthan an equivalent non-invasive device (e.g. there are invasive and non-invasive blood\\npressure monitors). Similarly, devices that have a long duration of contact, that affect\\nvital organs such the heart or the great arteries, or that have systemic effects are assigned\\nhigher classes of potential hazard or risk. The degree of regulation imposed on any device\\nis proportional to its potential hazard. This approach is known as _**risk management**_ .\",\n",
      "    \"The first requirement of the “Essential principles of safety and performance of medical\\ndevices” recommended by the GHTF (SG1-N020R5) illustrates such an approach. It states\\nthat:\\n\\nMedical devices should be designed and manufactured in such a way that, when\\nused under the conditions and for the purposes intended and, where applicable, by\\nvirtue of the technical knowledge, experience, education or training of intended\\nusers, they will not compromise the clinica\"\n",

Like medicines and other health technologies, they are essential\\nfor patient care – at the bedside, at the rural health clinic or at the large, specialized\\nhospital.', 'Medical devices also cost governments a substantial amount of money. In 2000, the\\nestimated one and a half million different medical devices available on the market\\nrepresented over US$145 billion. With innovation and the rapid advancement of\\ntechnologies, medical devices are currently one of the fastest growing industries, and the\\nglobal market figure for 2006 is expected to exceed US$260 billion.', 'Yet many countries lack access to high-quality devices and equipment that are\\nappropriate for their specific epidemiological needs. This is particularly true in developing\\ncountries, where health technology assessments are rare and where little regulatory controls\\nexist to prevent the importation or use of substandard devices. With the vast majority of\\ndevices in developing countries being imported, this leaves them prey to unscrupulous\\nmarket influences and puts patients’ lives at risk.', 'Governments need to put in place policies that will address all elements related to\\nmedical devices, ranging from access to high quality, affordable products, through to\\ntheir safe and appropriate use and disposal. The health technology life cycle diagram\\n(back cover) illustrates the policy process that needs to be in place. However, policies will\\nbe unsuccessful unless they are translated into national regulations that are enforced by\\nlegislation and correlating sanctions, and that form an integral part of the overall national\\nhealth system.', 'Surprisingly, regulatory controls for medical devices are scarce in the developing world,\\neven though implementation of national medical device regulations will often address the\\nvery issues raised in countries as major concerns for patient safety. Examples of these\\nissues include the illegal re-processing and re-packaging of used syringes for re-sale; the\\navailability on the market of equipment that fails minimum quality and safety standards;\\nor simply no trace of what devices are being sold in the country, nor by whom. Such a\\nlisting is essential to enable governments to issue alerts or recalls for unsafe or ineffective\\nitems.', 'The purpose of this publication is to provide guidance to Member States wishing to\\ncreate or modify their own regulatory systems for medical devices. It is recognized that\\nthere is no single template that will respond to the needs of every country. Some countries\\nmay have production facilities that will require good manufacturing practice and complex\\nquality controls; others may depend principally on the donation of equipment from external\\nsources and need different policies to protect their population against unsafe and\\ninappropriate technology. Resources, both human and financial, remain a significant factor\\nin the progressive development of national regulatory authorities. Nevertheless, there are\\nmany ways that governments can benefit from the wealth of experience of others, and', 'start to build efficient medical device regulatory systems. This publication highlights the\\nmost important of these.\\nIn essence, governments are encouraged to follow the growing movement towards\\nharmonized regulatory systems because a proliferation of different national regulations\\nincreases costs, hinders access to health care technologies, and can even unwittingly\\njeopardize the safety of the patient.', 'Secondly, Member States can adopt where appropriate the device approvals of the\\nadvanced regulatory systems, since this process represents a vast, and often unnecessary\\ndrain on scarce resources.', 'This will allow countries with weak regulatory systems to place emphasis and initial\\nresources on areas such as vendor and device registration, training, and surveillance and\\ninformation exchange systems on the assessment of medical devices in use.\\nWHO is reinforcing its role in providing technical support to Member States who wish\\nto implement improved medical device regulatory systems. We hope that this guide provides\\na useful framework within which countries can assess and address their needs to protect\\ntheir populations from the risks of unsafe technology.', '_Dr Vladimir K.

The intended primary\\nmode of action of a medical device on the human body, in contrast with that of medicinal\\nproducts, is not metabolic, immunological, or pharmacological.', 'Several different international classification systems for medical devices are still in use\\nin the world today. The World Health Organization, with its partners, is working towards\\nachieving harmonization in medical device nomenclature, which will have a significant\\nimpact on patient safety (see section 4.5). This is particularly important to be able to\\nidentify adverse incident reports and recalls.', 'The Global Harmonization Task Force has proposed the following harmonized definition\\nfor medical devices (see GHTF document SG1/N029R11).\\n\\n“Medical device” means any instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, appliance,\\nimplant, _in vitro_ reagent or calibrator, software, material or other similar or related\\narticle, intended by the manufacturer to be used, alone or in combination, for human\\nbeings for one or more of the specific purposes of:\\n\\n   - diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease\\n\\n   - diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury\\n\\n   - investigation, replacement, modification, or support of the anatomy or of a\\nphysiological process\\n\\n   - supporting or sustaining life\\n\\n   - control of conception\\n\\n   - disinfection of medical devices\\n\\n   - providing information for medical purposes by means of _in vitro_ examination of\\nspecimens derived from the human body and which does not achieve its primary\\nintended action in or on the human body by pharmacological, immunological or\\nmetabolic means, but which may be assisted in its function by such means.', '_Note:_ An accessory is not considered to be a medical device. However, where an\\naccessory is intended specifically by its manufacturer to be used together with the\\n‘parent’ medical device to enable the medical device to achieve its intended purpose,\\nit should be subject to the same procedures and GHTF guidance documents as apply\\nto the medical device itself.', '_Note:_ The definition of a device for _in vitro_ examination includes, for example,\\nreagents, calibrators, sample collection devices, control materials, and related\\ninstruments or apparatus. The information provided by such an _in vitro_ diagnostic\\ndevice may be for diagnostic, monitoring or compatibility purposes.

This will enhance the safety and performance of medical\\ndevices in use around the world.', '**Annexes 1–4** also provide a selection of further reading and information on the issues\\nraised in this publication.', '**2**\\n\\nMEDICAL DEVICE REGULATIONS\\n\\nCHAPTER 2\\n##### **Medical device safety**\\n\\nThe optimum assurance of medical device safety has several essential elements:\\n\\n - Absolute safety cannot be guaranteed\\n\\n  - It is a risk management issue\\n\\n  - It is closely aligned with device effectiveness/performance\\n\\n  - It must be considered throughout the life span of the device\\n\\n  - It requires shared responsibility among the stakeholders\\n\\nEach of these features is discussed below.', '**2.1 Medical device safety and risk management**\\nSafety can only be considered in relative terms. All devices carry a certain degree of risk\\nand could cause problems in specific circumstances. Many medical device problems cannot\\nbe detected until extensive market experience is gained. For example, an implantable\\ndevice may fail in a manner that was not predictable at the time of implantation; the\\nfailure may reflect conditions unique to certain patients. For other devices, component\\nfailure can also be unpredictable or random. The current approach to device safety is to\\nestimate the potential of a device becoming a hazard that could result in safety problems\\nand harm. This estimate is often referred to as the _**risk assessment**_ .', 'Hazard is a potential for an adverse event, a source of danger. Risk is a measure of the\\ncombination of (1) the hazard; (2) the likelihood of occurrence of the adverse event; (3)\\nthe severity or overall impact. Risk assessment begins with _**risk analysis**_ to identify all\\npossible hazards, followed by _**risk evaluation**_ to estimate the risk of each hazard. In\\ngeneral, risk assessment is based on experience, evidence, computation, or even guesswork.\\nRisk assessment is complex, as it can be influenced by personal perception and other\\nfactors such as cultural background, economic conditions, and political climates.', 'In practice, risk assessment of medical devices is based on the experience of health care\\nprofessionals and on safety design engineering. In the United States, governmental risk\\nassessment of medical devices is based mainly on recommendations from members of 16\\nmedical specialty panels, and devices are categorized into three classes. In the European\\nUnion and Canada, the classification schemes for medical devices are predominantly rulebased. These rules categorize medical devices according to their perceived potential hazards.', 'Canada assigns four classes of devices. The European Union assigns three classes with\\nclass II being sub-divided into IIa and IIb (effectively, also four classes). The Global\\nHarmonization Task Force (GHTF) is proposing a harmonized scheme for medical device\\nclassification (see www.GHTF.org document SG1/N015R18).', 'In classifying devices, potential areas of hazard that warrant consideration include the\\ndegree of invasiveness, duration of contact, the body system affected, and local versus\\nsystemic effects. An invasive device is usually considered to have higher potential hazard\\nthan an equivalent non-invasive device (e.g. there are invasive and non-invasive blood\\npressure monitors). Similarly, devices that have a long duration of contact, that affect\\nvital organs such the heart or the great arteries, or that have systemic effects are assigned\\nhigher classes of potential hazard or risk. The degree of regulation imposed on any device\\nis proportional to its potential hazard. This approach is known as _**risk management**_ .', 'The first requirement of the “Essential principles of safety and performance of medical\\ndevices” recommended by the GHTF (SG1-N020R5) illustrates such an approach. It states\\nthat:\\n\\nMedical devices should be designed and manufactured in such a way that, when\\nused under the conditions and for the purposes intended and, where applicable, by\\nvirtue of the technical knowledge, experience, education or training of intended\\nusers, they will not compromise the clinica']}\n",

registered with the FDA.', 'With all five authorities, the licensing or registration process also imposes obligations on the vendor for post-market surveillance and/or duties.', 'It is critically important that the safety and performance of medical devices are continually assessed when they are in use, as these characteristics can only be proven if one measures how a device stands up in these conditions.', 'No amount of rigour in the pre-marketing review process can predict all possible device failures or incidents arising from device misuse.', 'It is through actual use that unforeseen problems related to safety and performance can occur.', 'Different terms in medical device vigilance and post-market surveillance have varying meanings in different countries.', 'Whilst the GHTF is defining these terms, this document will use the definitions of the US FDA (see www.fda.gov/cdrh/postsurv/).', 'Post-market surveillance is a broad term that covers all monitoring activities of medical devices in use.', 'The two principal activities within surveillance are “post-market surveillance studies” and “adverse event reporting”.', 'In post-market surveillance studies, specific and structured data collections are required of the manufacturer in one of two situations: (1) as a condition of product approval, or (2) to re-affirm product safety when post-market adverse event reports suggest that pre-market safety claims are inconsistent with actual use and result in unacceptable risk.', 'Japanese authorities and the FDA actively make use of surveillance data collection to augment the findings of pre-market trials.', 'Adverse event reporting requires the registration and investigation of adverse events relating to the use of a device, and the authority necessary to oblige the manufacturer to recall or modify a defective device.', 'All founding members of the GHTF have mandatory requirements for vendors or manufacturers to report all device-related events that have resulted, or could result, in serious injury or death.', 'In some countries, mandatory adverse event reporting is also extended to users.', 'Post-market surveillance is interrelated to the quality system requirements described in the following section.', 'A Quality System is defined as the organizational structure, responsibilities, procedures, processes and resources needed to implement quality management.', 'Quality system standards are “generic management standards” and are described in section 5.1.', 'The international quality system standards for medical devices are issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) (ISO13485:1996 and ISO13488: 1996).', 'ISO13485:1996 includes all the elements of ISO9001:1994 plus a set of minimum supplementary requirements for medical devices.', 'The relationship between ISO9001:1994 and ISO13485:1996 is described in Annex 3.', 'ISO13488:1996 is the same as ISO13485: 1994, but without the design control requirements.', 'A new standard, ISO13485:200?, is currently being developed and will become the international reference standard for medical devices.', 'Regulations for quality systems may cover the methods, facilities and controls used by the manufacturer in the design, manufacture, packaging, labelling, storage, installation, servicing and post-market handling of medical devices.', 'Therefore, quality system requirements can influence all phases in the medical device life span.', 'Applicable requirements depend upon the risk class of the device and on the regulatory system of the country.', 'Design control is normally not required for regulatory scrutiny in medium- to low-risk devices.', 'When applied to the manufacturing process, quality system requirements impose strict quality assurance on every aspect of production.', 'The result is a tightly controlled manufacturing system, commonly known as Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), which reduces the likelihood of non-conforming products.', 'This practice ensures consistency in the quality and provides the basis for greater reliability in device safety and performance.', 'Elements of the quality system are periodically subject to audits, management review, and corrective or preventive actions that will maintain product quality.', 'Continuous monitoring and corrective action requirements are interrelated to post-market surveillance previously described.', 'The key advantage regarding quality systems is that they represent a preventive approach to assuring medical device quality versus the previous reactive approach by inspection and rejection at the end of the manufacturing line.', 'Prevention has been proven to be more efficient and cost effective in controlling manufacturing processes and maintaining medical device quality.', 'It is important to note that since the majority of medical devices are in the medium- to low-risk classes, their compliance with regulations often depends upon the declarations of manufacturers, thus the question of quality assurance naturally arises.', 'This is why it is critical for manufacturers to conform with quality system standards and for this conformity to be subject to periodic audit by governmental or third party agencies.', 'All founding members of the GHTF have quality system requirements for their manufacturers, who are subject to periodic inspection by the government and/or accredited third party agencies.', 'The applicable standard is determined by the risk class of the device and depends upon the regulatory system of the country or region.', 'With the rapid growth in the global market for medical devices, there is a need to harmonize national standards in order to minimize regulatory barriers and to facilitate trade.', 'Harmonization also reduces the cost of local industry and government regulations.', 'The next chapter summarizes the work of the Global Harmonization Task Force to find common elements and ways to unify the different national standards and regulatory practices.', 'Medical devices, like drugs, are used worldwide.', 'With the rapid growth in the global market for medical devices, there is a need to harmonize national standards in order to minimize regulatory barriers, facilitate trade and improve access to new technologies.', 'Harmonization also reduces the cost of implementing regulations for governments and local industry.', 'The Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) was founded in 1993 by the governments and industry representatives of Australia, Canada, Japan, the European Union, and the United States of America to address these issues.', 'The purpose of the GHTF is to encourage a convergence in standards and regulatory practices related to the safety, performance and quality of medical devices.', 'The GHTF also promotes technological innovation and facilitates international trade.', 'The primary means by which its goals are accomplished is via the publication and dissemination of harmonized guidance documents for basic regulatory practices.', 'These documents, which are developed by four different GHTF Study Groups, can then be adopted/implemented by member national regulatory authorities or others.', 'Technical committee members include representatives from national medical device regulatory authorities and the regulated industry.', 'Study Group 1: is charged with comparing operational medical device regulatory systems around the world and from that comparison, isolating the elements/principles that are suitable for harmonization and those that may present obstacles to uniform regulations.', 'In addition, the group is also responsible for developing a standardized format for pre-market submissions and harmonized product labelling requirements.', 'Study Group 2: examines the requirements for: 1. the reporting of adverse events involving medical devices, 2. post-market surveillance and other forms of vigilance.', 'In addition, it is responsible for recommending ways of harmonizing the requirements, and for providing a discussion forum for harmonization initiatives.', 'Study Group 3: is responsible for examining existing quality system requirements in countries that already have well-developed device regulatory systems and identifying areas suitable for harmonization.', 'Study Group 4: is charged with the task of examining quality system auditing practices (initially among the founding members of the GHTF) and developing guidance documents that lay out harmonized principles for medical device auditing.', 'It may be helpful to relate the roles of these four groups to the medical device life span.', 'With the exception of commercial activities including advertising and sales, which give freedom to local variations, the GHTF Study Groups are involved in all aspects that have direct impact on the safety and performance of medical devices.', 'Therefore, recommendations from the GHTF Task Forces can provide excellent reference or guidance for countries that are establishing medical devices regulation programmes.', 'By following recommendations from the GHTF, countries can ensure that their regulatory controls are not in significant conflict with global harmonization recommendations.', 'The GHTF is directing and converging the harmonized guidance documents.', 'Critical issues such as safety and performance requirements, quality systems, standards and procedures of post-market surveillance are studied in-depth by experts from different countries to reach consensual recommendations and these are incorporated into the GHTF final guidance documents.', 'Global harmonization and cooperation in post-market surveillance will facilitate an international devices data bank that allows rapid, global access to device information, alerts or recalls.', 'This will promote the safety and effectiveness of medical devices.', 'Where a country’s programme is harmonized with the programmes of other countries, regulatory burdens and costs for local government and industry will be significantly reduced, while regulatory cooperation, commerce and international trade will be enhanced.', 'Other emerging issues of international significance can be put to the GHTF for a common solution.', 'GHTF provides an opportunity for countries to participate and observe regulatory developments that they could adopt.', 'The current trend towards a regional harmonization will be useful for countries and can be supported by WHO’s parallel regional structure.', 'For example, at the 1998 GHTF Meeting in Australia, the Asian Harmonisation Working Party (AHWP) held its first formal meeting and at the 1999 GHTF meeting in the United States, medical device regulators of the Americas launched a regional GHTF group.', 'As at June 2003, 19 final guidance documents supported by consensus of the regulators and industry representatives of the GHTF founding members have been published.', 'These are listed in Annex 2 with an indication of how they relate to the common framework developed in this Guide.', 'Each document is identified by study group (SG) and document numbers.', 'Details of other recommendations under development by GHTF Study Groups may also be found at www.ghtf.org.', 'Achieving consistency in nomenclature is fundamental to the overall goal of international harmonization, particularly for the identification of devices involved in adverse incident reports.', 'In 1993, the European Commission mandated the ‘Comité Européen de Normalisation’ (CEN) to produce a standard indicating the structure of a nomenclature system that could meet the needs of the global market.', 'The International Standards Organization was invited to participate to ensure that international considerations were addressed.', 'The resulting standard was adopted as ‘EN/ISO 15225 Nomenclature – Specification for a nomenclature system for medical devices for the purposes of regulatory data exchange’.', 'Before the creation of the Global Medical Device Nomenclature (GMDN) in 1997, a multitude of nomenclatures were being used, including the Universal Medical Device Nomenclature System.', 'With the introduction of the European Directives for medical device regulations, the need for a standardized international nomenclature became clear.', 'WHO supports wide consultation to adopt a single, harmonized option.', 'The GMDN, endorsed by the GHTF as the global nomenclature to be used by regulators for the classification and registration of medical devices, is intended: 1. to give a common generic description for every general term that describes characteristics of a medical device.', 'This is to be used for identifying similar devices to those involved in an adverse incident report; 2. to identify a device, using the generic term, for having been awarded a specific design or other certificate; 3. to serve as a basis for E-commerce – to provide a generic basis for purchasing individual types of manufactured devices, by establishing a heading for comparison of products from different manufacturers.', 'Further information on the GMDN can be found at http://www.gmdn.info/', 'The understanding of standards systems, the standards development process and their use in conformity assessment has become essential in establishing medical device regulations.', 'In this chapter, a general introduction to standards will be provided.', 'This is followed by a description of current trends in the use of voluntary standards in medical device regulations and related recommendations of the GHTF.', 'The formal definition of a standard that should be adopted in the medical device domain is given by the ISO:', 'Standards are documented agreements containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines or definitions of characteristics, to ensure that materials, products, process and

alphabetical prefix and a number.', 'The letters (e.g. ISO, IEC, ANSI, CAN, EN, DIN) indicate the body that has approved them, while the numbers identify the specific standard and the year in which it was finalized.', 'The standard reference code often gives an indication of adoption where standards are equivalent.', 'For example: CAN/CSA-Z386-94 means a standard developed in 1994 by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA, one of four accredited Canadian standards development organizations) and designated by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) as a Canadian national standard.',

European standard (EN), which is itself an adoption of the International Standard ISO9001.', 'Although a standard can be set and mandated by an authority, the current trend is for the adoption of voluntary standards established by consensus from all interested parties (the stakeholders).', 'The use of voluntary standards originated from the realization that while regulations generally address the essential safety and performance principles, manufacturers and users still need to know detailed specifications pertaining to specific products.', 'The provision of such specifications and detailed requirements for the multitude of devices presents an enormous task for regulatory authorities.', 'Fortunately, the wealth of voluntary standards already existing or being developed provide such precise specifications.', 'The use of voluntary/consensus standards has many advantages including the following: They are normally developed by experts with access to the vast resources available in the professional and industrial communities.', 'By taking advantage of such existing resources, the government can overcome its own limited resources for providing product specific technical requirements and characteristics.', 'Conformity to standards can also be assessed by an accredited third party (such as a notified body in Europe), which is a well-established industrial practice around the world.', 'The use of international standards facilitates harmonized regulatory processes and world trade, and thus improves global access to new technology.', 'As technology advances, it is

(section 6.3.3) by including this in their legislation.', 'The GHTF document SG1 N015R18 has been drafted to provide a rule-based system in classifying medical devices (see section 3.4.1).', 'It contains 16 rules and decision trees to demonstrate how these rules should be used to classify specific devices.', 'The document will be of value to countries developing or amending regulations.', 'Regulatory authorities that are developing new classification schemes or amending existing ones are encouraged to consider the adoption of this system, as this will help to reduce the diversity of systems worldwide and facilitate the process of harmonization.', 'Pre-market approval is one of the most important aspects of any comprehensive policy.', 'The difficulty of establishing a local pre-market review team is not just financial but also depends on whether specialized scientific and clinical expertise is available in the country.', 'However, with the work of the GHTF and the ability to look at approval decisions in other countries, it is now feasible for many countries to avoid the expense of a local pre market review team.', 'Global statistics on medical device manufacturers reveal that the US, Japan and EU countries manufacture approximately 85% of the medical devices in the world (see Figure 9 below).', 'They already have comprehensive regulatory systems in place that follow the “Essential Principles of Safety and Performance of Medical Devices” recommended by the GHTF.', 'This is a positive development for the other countries of the world that import most of their medical devices.', 'As an alternative to a local pre-market review team, a government can adopt a policy of accepting devices that are manufactured in compliance with the regulations of another country.', 'The choices include, for example, devices with an Australian, Canadian or Japanese License, devices with a European “CE” mark, or devices that have been granted marketing clearance by the US-FDA.', 'In this way the citizens of the importing country will be assured of the same risk exposure as the citizens of the exporting countries.', 'Whether to grant local marketing rights to that device remains a local government decision, which may rest on local socioeconomic considerations and technology assessment information.', 'Since it may be necessary to verify the authenticity of EU regulatory compliance, device suppliers can be asked to obtain an “export certificate”, the nominal cost of which may be passed on to the importer.', 'However, since export certificates can differ in purpose and format, it is important to be cautious when relying on them (section 6.6 discusses this issue).', 'A similar approach can be used for local medical device manufacturers.', 'The government can require that local manufacturers make submissions for compliance acceptance to a country that has an accepted pre-market review team.', 'In fact, this is what the manufacturers have to do anyway if they want to sell internationally.', 'If a country has competent private organizations, the government has the option to authorize such organizations to perform the pre-market assessment, as is now carried out by the European Union.', 'The Quality System certification of local manufacturing facilities is usually delegated to authorized third party agents (such as the notified bodies in the EU, or Quality Systems Registrars in Australia and Canada).', 'In the case of the United States, the FDA, following the completion of an inspection, can issue a letter to the firm denoting their compliance status.', 'Currently the cost of inspection is borne by the FDA, and is performed, almost without exception, by FDA employees.', 'In avoiding the expense and effort of a pre-market review team, a government can concentrate on implementing vendor and device registration and surveillance programmes for devices in use.', 'Product representation is controlled through labelling during the pre-market stage and advertising of the product during the on-market stage.', 'Labelling requirements include identification of the device, instructions for use, as well as safety- and performance-related information.', 'A harmonized format for labelling is recommended by the GHTF (SG1 N009R6).', 'Advertising control is an important tool for ensuring that the public is protected from misleading and fraudulent claims as described in section 6.2.1.', 'Vendor establishment control allows the government to be informed of which establishments are selling what devices.', 'Its main purpose is to establish contact with vendors in case of adverse events and also to inform the local vendors of their responsibility for after-sale obligations.', 'In most countries, only one level of in-country vendor is required to be registered for control.', 'For example, if the importer or the distributor were already registered, then it would not be necessary to register the retailers of the same device.', 'There are two general ways to accomplish vendor establishment control: (1) Sales notification, and (2) establishment license or registration.', '_**Sales notification**_ is generally a less effective method.', 'Vendors are automatically permitted to sell medical devices provided that they notify the regulatory authority, either before or after the sale, as required by the authority.', '_**Establishment License or Registration**_, on the other hand, requires that the vendor either obtains a license or is registered before they are allowed to sell medical devices.', 'This method has several advantages: It ensures that the government has a record of the vendor; It enables the government to place emphasis on after-sale obligations; It provides a means for the government to enforce requirements; for example, it will be able to suspend a license if the vendor does not fulfil after-sale responsibilities; It allows the government to require an annual renewal of the license or registration in order to maintain updated information on the vendors.', 'Since the latter method places considerable demand on the government, the government can impose a fee on the licensing or registration process.', 'This fee will help defray the cost of administration.', 'The fee may also help to strengthen the vendor’s efforts to fulfil their obligations so that they avoid losing the license that they have paid for.', 'Experience from Canada reveals that an establishment licence is a more effective means than sales notification for keeping records of the vendors (see www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hpfb-dgpsa/tpd-dpt/ for Canadian guidance documents on establishment licensing).', 'A recent development in the medical device market is the rapid increase in the number and variety of home-use medical devices.', 'This results in a shift from institution-based professional users of medical devices to their employment by lay users.', 'Here, education of the consumer is key to safety and performance.', 'Formerly, used or refurbished medical devices were traded to developing countries, mainly by third parties, and the vendors were often opportunistic merchants with no technical expertise.', 'Many recipient countries had very bad experiences with used equipment because there were no after-sale technical support or spare parts.', 'By 2002, at least five countries had imposed a total ban on the import of used equipment and 17 others have partial bans depending on the type of equipment.', 'The situation has changed rapidly over the past 10 years due to shrinking health care budgets and rapid technological innovations.', 'Refurbished medical equipment is increasingly being used within the United States and other industrialized countries.', 'As larger hospitals purchase the latest models, they trade in their superseded equipment which is often still in good condition.', 'This equipment can remain suitable for a wide range of applications, both for city and rural hospitals, and large global medical device manufacturers are now participating in the business of refurbishment.', 'As a result of the increasing use of refurbished equipment in industrialized countries, the question of regulations is raised.', 'Work is under way to define the scope of refurbished equipment and the different requirements for their regulation.']}\n",
